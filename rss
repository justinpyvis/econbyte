        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before we get into the latest example of overlawyering in the US, some housekeeping: this will be the <strong>last ever</strong> EconByte newsletter. I'm going to archive a static version of the website but there will be no new content or emails from now on.</p><p>The main reason for the retirement is that I'm now publishing on a separate platform 5 days a week: <a href="https://brekkywrap.com">Brekky Wrap</a>. It has more of an Australian focus but there's also plenty on global markets and technology that should interest even those who couldn't care less about what's happening down under. It's digestible in just a few minutes and is also free, so if you haven't already done so feel free to <a href="https://brekkywrap.com">sign up</a>.</p><p>Another reason for closing this down is that I want to experiment with other mediums and spend more time working on a book (tbc). For now, I've set up a <a href="https://writefreely.org/">WriteFreely</a> instance on the fediverse – called <a href="https://detrended.com/">Detrended</a> – which will have more of an ad hoc publishing schedule and no emails. You can keep up with posts there using any RSS/Atom reader or by following it on the <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse">fediverse</a>.</p><p>Anyway, on to the final issue.</p><hr><p>Last week, a judge unsanctimoniously dismissed the US Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) antitrust lawsuit against Facebook:</p><blockquote>The FTC's Complaint says almost nothing concrete on the key question of how much power Facebook actually had, and still has, in a properly defined antitrust product market. It is almost as if the agency expects the Court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist.</blockquote><p>The judge also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court">dismissed</a> a separate case attempting to divest Facebook of WhatsApp and Instagram, signed by nearly every state attorney general, "holding that a specific civil law doctrine prevented the coalition from challenging acquisitions settled so many years in the past".</p><p>You would think that criticism as scathing as that might be enough to deter even the most fervorous antitrust zealots. But that's unlikely given that President Biden recently appointed Lina Khan to chair the FTC, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/ftc-lina-khan-antitrust-chair-497764">a 32-year old law professor</a> specialising in antitrust "who made her reputation as a critic of tech giants". The judge also made it clear that the FTC can revive its case by 29 July, if it's able to "plead enough facts to plausibly establish" that Facebook is violating antitrust laws, "namely, that Facebook has monopoly power in the market for Personal Social Networking Services".</p><p>That said, I'm not sure if the FTC will bother trying to fight this antitrust case, mostly because I don't think it can. Facebook just doesn't have a monopoly, as it has historically been defined. It doesn't charge consumers (where's the consumer harm?), doesn't collect monopoly rents (even in advertising), doesn't restrict supply and can't increase prices for users or advertisers without fear of competition.</p><p>Do "network effects" make it more difficult to leave Facebook? Absolutely. But that doesn't make Facebook a monopoly any more than it made MySpace a monopoly. If a better rat trap comes along, you can be sure people will switch to it. Facebook is dominant because people like it, not because it's the only social network in town.</p><p>Now that doesn't mean the FTC will give up. No, you can be sure that the FTC will have tunnel vision for Big Tech until the end of Khan's term. Amazon is so concerned that last week it <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/30/tech/amazon-ftc-lina-khan/index.html">asked a judge</a> that she be recused from all Amazon-related antitrust cases before the agency, as she apparently:</p><blockquote>...has on numerous occasions argued that Amazon is guilty of antitrust violations and should be broken up. These statements convey to any reasonable observer the clear impression that she has already made up her mind about many material facts relevant to Amazon's antitrust culpability as well as about the ultimate issue of culpability itself.</blockquote><p>While any sensible judge will throw out Big Tech antitrust claims <em>as the law is currently written</em>, there's a good chance that the Biden administration will try to change the law. Early in June US House Democrats <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/regulating-crypto/">unveiled five separate bills</a> aimed at Big Tech, and Biden has signalled his intentions not just with the appointment of Khan but also <a href="https://time.com/6076975/facebook-ftc-antitrust-reform/">Tim Wu</a>, "a critic of anticompetitive conduct by Big Tech companies, as his special advisor for technology and competition policy".</p><p>How this plays out will be incredibly important. Productivity is essential for growth, and you <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Productivity.html">only get that</a> through increased savings or innovation. While there's no doubt regulation could help improve things on many margins, there's also a gigantic risk that any new laws are ill-conceived, poorly written or outright captured by Big Tech, unleashing unintended consequences that could suffocate the most vibrant sector in the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Rosengren, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, last week <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-fed-official-calls-tether-a-challenge-to-financial-stability-2021-06-25">singled out Tether</a> – a so-called stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar – as posing "financial stability challenges":</p><blockquote>The reason I talked about Tether and stablecoins is if you look at their portfolio, it basically looks like a portfolio of a prime money market fund but maybe riskier... [it] has a number of assets that, during the pandemic, the spread got quite wide on those assets. <br>... <br>I do think we need to think more broadly about what could disrupt short term credit markets over time, and certainly stablecoins are one element. I do worry that the stablecoin market that is currently, pretty much unregulated as it grows and becomes a more important sector of our economy, that we need to take seriously what happens when people run from these type of instruments very quickly.</blockquote><p>Created in 2014, Tether's primary function is to provide liquidity to cryptocurrency exchanges and facilitate decentralised finance – 'DeFi'. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/a-sudden-loss-of-faith-in-tether-would-pose-risk-to-bitcoin-jpmorgan-says">According to</a> asset manager NYDIG and cited by JPMorgan, around 50%-60% of bitcoin has traded for USDT ('tether') since 2019. It has a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/">market cap</a> of approximately $US62.5 billion, which would rank it in <a href="https://www.advratings.com/banking/worlds-top-banks-by-market-cap">the mid-30s</a> in terms of the world's largest banks by market capitalisation (somewhere between the National Australia Bank and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group), but hasn't produced a single independent audit. Its balance sheet is essentially a black box – 'trust us'.</p><p>The only information anyone has about Tether (outside of its <a href="https://craft.co/tether-holdings">11 employees</a> – not a typo!) is what is <a href="https://wallet.tether.to/transparency">published on its website</a>. Again, it's all completely unaudited.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/06/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1200" height="613" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/image.png 1000w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/06/image.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Tether's asset breakdown.</figcaption></figure><p>As usual with these sorts of things, <em>caveat emptor</em> applies: buyer beware! Even if Tether's disclosures are true (and it hasn't engaging in fractional-reserve banking to manipulate crypto prices, as some speculate), that would still mean 49.6% of its assets are in "commercial paper", with just 3.87% in cash. </p><p>That leaves Tether very exposed to market gyrations – what happens if there's a corporate bond crisis in the US, prices tank and people try to redeem their tether at the same time? Simple: Tether becomes insolvent and implodes, much like Bernie Madoff's infamous 20-year Ponzi scheme only unravelled during the global market downturn in 2008.</p><p>But the issues with Tether don't apply to all stablecoins. <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">Circle's USD Coin</a> ('USDC'), for example, is fully backed by US fiat and is publicly audited by accounting firm Grant Thornton every month. It has been snatching market share from Tether as doubts about the latter's solvency have grown, especially after the state of New York <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal">found it guilty</a> of "overstating reserves [and] hiding approximately $850 million in losses around the globe".</p><p>If Tether is indeed some kind of Ponzi scheme, it will eventually blow up. Will it disrupt the broader crypto market? Absolutely. But it's unlikely to pose "financial stability challenges".</p><p>However, what is clear is that cryptocurrencies and so-called stablecoins in particular will be facing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e6e7d9d6-7778-4286-ba6f-e5831fcbc538">increased regulatory scrutiny</a> in the coming months. And that's a good thing, provided it's done right – in the long run, a more mature, open and robust crypto market will only help it grow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 800 suspected criminals <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-57394831">were arrested</a> across the world earlier this month "after being tricked into using an FBI-run encrypted messaging app". The plot was concocted back in 2018 while Australian authorities and the FBI were knocking back a few cold ones (no doubt celebrating Australia's new <em>Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018</em>), "when they hatched a plan to exploit the communications network for their own ends: by surreptitiously taking control of AN0M and using it as window into criminal activities".</p><blockquote>"I wasn't there," Australia's federal police commissioner Reece Kershaw told reporters on Tuesday, "but as you know some of the best ideas come over a couple of beers."</blockquote><p>The full details, for obvious reasons, are scant. But the fact that Australian authorities were heavily involved is probably because it has the worst digital privacy laws in the world. The <em>Assistance and Access Bill 2018 </em>cited above <a href="https://blogs.dlapiper.com/privacymatters/australia-assistance-and-access-act-december-2018-holy-grail-of-uncertainty-created-by-new-rushed-in-data-encryption-laws/">allows authorities</a> to compel individuals or companies to do one or more specified 'acts or things' necessary to assist agencies, without judicial oversight.</p><p>While the <em>Assistance and Access Bill 2018</em> has never been used for anything terrorism related (the original justification for the bill), the Australian Federal Police (AFP) confirmed that the global sting was only possible because of it, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/experts-unclear-how-australian-encryption-busting-laws-were-used-in-global-crime-bust-20210609-p57zga.html">although it was</a> "not in a position to elaborate further due to legislative requirements within the relevant acts".</p><p>Should we care that a bunch of criminals were busted by an elaborate honeypot? No. This isn't the first time the US government has built a product from the ground up with the aim of spying on criminals and foreign governments: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG">Crypto AG</a>, a Swiss communications and information security company that operated from 1970 until 2018, was created by the CIA to sell backdoored products.</p><p>Indeed, the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3x3b5/trojan-shield-operation-ironside-fbi-an0m">stupidity</a> of these so-called crime bosses is staggering:</p><blockquote>Ayik is the founding member of the "Aussie Cartel" – a syndicate formed by some of Australia's most wanted crime bosses that smuggles an estimated $1.5 billion AUD worth of drugs into the country each year – and is currently Australia’s most wanted priority target. He recommended AN0M to criminal associates, who would purchase mobile devices that had been preloaded with the app on the black market. <br><br>These phones could not make calls or send emails, and could only send messages to another device that had the same app, according to a statement by the AFP. Criminals needed to know a criminal to get a device. They would then use the encrypted messaging software to send messages, distort messages and take videos. <br><br>High-profile organised crime figures vouched for the app’s integrity – and by the time authorities swooped more than 10,000 people were using AN0M devices across the world, including more than 1,600 in Australia.</blockquote><p>Encryption is trustworthy. Random, invite-only closed source apps are not. You would think that given their threat model, hardened criminals might at a minimum use something that has had its source code audited by a trusted party. Better yet, a messaging app that's completely open source. Or keep it simple by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a> with a key they themselves created and distributed. It would literally take a minute to set up.</p><p>The fact that these 'high-profile organised crime figures' vouching for the app's integrity blindly trusted a secretive, closed-source app suggests they would probably have been caught eventually anyway.</p><p>But what we should care about is Australia's involvement in all of this. The laws used to arrest a few hundred suspected criminals (the first 50 'beta testers' were <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shield-anom-fbi-secret-phone-network">already under surveillance</a>) "have <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au/2021/06/10/australias-anti-encryption-law-costs-billions-hurts-reputation/">undermined</a> international trust in Australia's digital services and their cybersecurity, increased business uncertainty, and hurt the brand image of Australian providers internationally", with costs "measurable in the multiple billions of dollars".</p><p><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/experts-unclear-how-australian-encryption-busting-laws-were-used-in-global-crime-bust-20210609-p57zga.html">According to</a> Digital Rights Watch executive director Lucie Krahulcova:</p><blockquote>It seems the FBI would not have been able to conduct this operation without the AFP. And that's because we have essentially one of the most invasive, most broad anti-encryption legislation in the world right now.</blockquote><p>Law Council of Australia president Jacoba Brasch QC <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/experts-unclear-how-australian-encryption-busting-laws-were-used-in-global-crime-bust-20210609-p57zga.html">said that</a> under the <em>Assistance and Access Bill 2018</em>, there is "no judicial involvement in the issuing process for orders compelling communications providers to render assistance".</p><p>You can be sure that following the success of this honeypot (which only came to an end after a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9662457/ANoM-AN0M-app-Australian-Federal-Police-Operation-Ironside-Blog-post-placed-sting-jeopardy.html">blogger did some analysis</a> on a device and revealed it to be a scam), every country in the world will soon be knocking on the AFP's door trying to get some judicial-free, backdoor surveillance action (well maybe not China).</p><p>The message from Australia's politicians is clear: if you want to start a digital company and need any kind of data security or user privacy, do not do it in Australia, a place where individual and enterprise trust in digital services no longer exists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is gearing up to regulate banks that hold cryptocurrency, as "the growth of crypto assets and related services has the potential to raise financial stability concerns and increase risks faced by banks". Unfortunately its proposed regulations completely miss the mark. According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3fe7be31-179a-47dd-9a61-8f4ea42b9c62">the FT</a>:</p><blockquote>All other [non-stablecoin] crypto assets, including bitcoin and ethereum, would go into the new, more strenuous regime. The Basel committee proposed a risk weight of 1,250 per cent, in line with the toughest standards for banks' exposures on riskier assets. <br><br>That would mean banks would in effect have to hold capital equal to the exposure they face, and be prepared if the value of the asset were worthless. A $100 exposure in bitcoin would result in a minimum capital requirement of $100, Basel said. <br><br>The standards would apply to assets created for decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but potential central bank digital currencies were outside the scope of the consultation, it added.</blockquote><p>I get that the regulator is concerned about stability, but the effect of these capital requirements will be to kick crypto to the curb – including the very promising DeFi – where it will be embraced by non-bank entities.</p><p>We've seen how excessive regulation can lead to growth in problematic shadow banking – well soon we may see a growing shadow crypto sector. A far better approach would be to update the rules to <em>incorporate</em> crypto, rather than kneecap it to the point that the only place it can thrive is outside of the traditional banking system.</p><p>There is a legitimate need to develop a proper, global regulatory framework that would allow institutions to access new DeFi services through the banking system. It really shouldn't be that difficult – most cryptocurrencies are actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/technology/bitcoin-untraceable-pipeline-ransomware.html">more traceable</a> than cash, given that they provide an open, immutable record of all transactions.</p><p>Then again, if the five Big Tech-busting bills released for review in the US last week are any indication (see below), perhaps proper regulation of crypto is indeed impossible.</p><h2 id="those-five-antitrust-bills">Those five antitrust bills</h2><p>US House Democrats on Friday unveiled <a href="https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/house-lawmakers-release-anti-monopoly-agenda-stronger-online-economy-opportunity">five separate bills</a> aimed at breaking up Big Tech. If you were to put several politicians in a room who knew nothing about technology and asked them to devise some new regulations... well this is close to what you would get: </p><ul><li><em>American Choice and Innovation Online Act</em>, to prohibit discriminatory conduct by dominant platforms, including a ban on self-preferencing and picking winners and losers online.</li><li><em>Platform Competition and Opportunity Act</em>, to prohibit acquisitions of competitive threats by dominant platforms, as well acquisitions that expand or entrench the market power of online platforms.</li><li><em>Ending Platform Monopolies Act</em>, to eliminate the ability of dominant platforms to leverage their control over across multiple business lines to self-preference and disadvantage competitors in ways that undermine free and fair competition.</li><li><em>Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act</em>, to promote competition online by lowering barriers to entry and switching costs for businesses and consumers through interoperability and data portability requirements.</li><li><em>Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act</em>, to update filing fees for mergers for the first time in two decades to ensure that Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission have the resources they need to aggressively enforce the antitrust laws.</li></ul><p>At least we finally get a<em> </em>definition out of this. Big Tech (i.e. companies covered by these Acts) are defined as those with 50 million US-based monthly active users, 100,000 US-based monthly active business users, or possessing a market capitalisation of more than $US600 billion. Right now that would include Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and maybe even Snapchat (which has close to 50 million US-based monthly active users). None of the metrics are indexed to population or inflation, meaning over a sufficient period of time they could become all-encompassing.</p><p>One important variable that isn't defined is "data", which will be provided "6 months after the date of enactment". So these Acts will go into force, require Big Tech to ensure things such as "all data must be portable", and "enable the secure transfer of data to a user", but <em>not provide a definition of data</em>?!</p><p>Not to mention that mandating data portability generally requires an assumption that the current way of doing things is the only way: will some future Facebook competitor be required to ensure its data are portable and interoperable with whatever today's regulators come up with? Surely not, but that's what will happen. The effect will be to lock-in some kind of standard and force every future entrant to comply accordingly, which would likely have the opposite effect to the stated goal: it would help Big Tech maintain its dominance and stymie innovation.</p><p>Then there's the effective prohibition on all mergers and acquisitions, with M&amp;A disallowed for any Big Tech company that might "compete with the covered platform... constitute nascent or potential competition to the covered platform... enhance or increase the covered platform operator's market position... or maintain its market position". Really?</p><p>There's plenty more nastiness inside each, feel free to <a href="https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/house-lawmakers-release-anti-monopoly-agenda-stronger-online-economy-opportunity">read them all here</a>. But essentially a handful of US companies will be regulated differently to every other business – without evidence of consumer harm – in a process that, if passed, will probably destroy many products consumers actually enjoy. 🙄👏</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Australian government's attack dog has given itself a big <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad706bd3-2aed-49da-b4f4-862f15a2e601">pat on the back</a> for successfully <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/facebook-strikes-back-as-google-folds/">shaking down</a> Google and Facebook with its <em>News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code</em>:</p><blockquote>Rod Sims, chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told the Financial Times on Tuesday that the country's world-first news media bargaining code had forced big technology platforms to the negotiating table to agree deals with publishers. <br><br>"We are on track for deals all around. It's been a big success," Sims said in an interview. "We are just about there and the media companies are happy — and that's the key point."</blockquote><p>The word "deal" is a generous use of the English language, which <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deal">defines it</a> as "an arrangement for mutual advantage". These deals are only mutually advantageous to the extent that the legislation allows Australia's Treasurer to arbitrarily "designate a digital platform as being under the news media bargaining code", unless a deal is struck resulting in "no need for designation under the code".</p><p>In other words, the costs being "designated" by the Code are so significant that it's in Google and Facebook's interest to agree to a completely one-sided deal to avoid having to "bargain" in the ACCC's kangaroo court. There's a serious lack of transparency: no details of any of the "deals" have been made public, although they're each rumoured to be in the tens of millions.</p><p>Essentially Facebook and Google have to pay a secret 'protection fee' to Australia's archaic, highly concentrated media companies or the government will beat them down with a big stick known as the <em>News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code</em>. The public is completely in the dark, the media companies are unaccountable to the taxpayer and any potential entrant must now compete against these dinosaurs <strong>plus</strong> the extra tens of millions of dollars with which they're now being subsidised.</p><p>No doubt a lucrative advisory gig at one of the legacy media companies awaits ACCC chair Rod Sims when his term expires in July 2022.</p><h2 id="solar-policy-and-unintended-consequences">Solar policy and unintended consequences</h2><p>A few days ago Bloomberg published a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/solar-jobs-2021-how-china-beat-u-s-to-become-world-s-solar-champion">good piece</a> summarising the demise of the US solar industry. It's a warning for fans of so-called industrial policy, with good intentions ruined by unintended but entirely predictable consequences.</p><blockquote>The [solar] industry failed to take root in the U.S. despite billions of dollars in government incentives and nearly two decades of pledges from presidents, starting with George W. Bush, that the nation would be a clean-energy superpower.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/06/china-solar-panel-surge.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="630" height="771" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/china-solar-panel-surge.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/06/china-solar-panel-surge.png 630w"></figure><p>In the early 2000's China was emerging as a major solar competitor to the US. So successive Presidents – before the 'Tariff Man' Donald Trump even came to power – whacked them with tariffs, with Obama raising them "as high as 249%", which... "spurred retaliation instead of a manufacturing renaissance":</p><blockquote>Manufacturers responded by moving operations out of China, but they didn't head to the U.S. Instead, large manufacturers skirted the U.S. tariffs by building facilities to assemble solar cells and modules across Southeast Asia.</blockquote><p>But it gets better:</p><blockquote>Making matters worse, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PRCH:CH">China</a> retaliated by imposing its own duties of up to 57% on imports of U.S.-made polysilicon -- tariffs that crippled U.S. producers of the conductive material used in solar panels.</blockquote><p>Instead of affordable, Chinese-taxpayer subsidised solar panels that made "solar as cheap as coal", the US raised the domestic price of solar, did not save the industry, and accidentally managed to kill off its thriving polysilicon industry, going "from making 50% of the world's polysilicon in 2007 to less than 5% today".</p><p>Unintended consequences from poorly conceived policy strike again. What's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_road_to_hell_is_paved_with_good_intentions">the saying</a> about good intentions again?</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is a data leviathan, gobbling up anything and everything it can on its users <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-tracking/facebook-fuels-broad-privacy-debate-by-tracking-non-users-idUSKBN1HM0DR">and non-users</a> alike. It does that for a reason – Facebook is not a social network but an advertising company. It needs as much data as it can get because it's competing with the likes of Google, Amazon and even traditional media for a limited number of advertising dollars.</p><p>Facebook has to prove that its adverts are better targetted than the competition – that its adverts are "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/about/?entry_product=ad_preferences">useful and relevant</a>", i.e. properly directed at the desired audience, generating more useful clicks. It has done a <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/">pretty good job</a> of that over the past decade:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Over 97% of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising." loading="lazy" width="911" height="661" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/image-2.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/image-2.png 911w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Over 97% of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising.</figcaption></figure><p>But recently the tide has started to turn and Facebook finds itself with a data problem.</p><p>The first blow was the <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/its-time-to-uninstall-whatsapp/">immense backlash</a> to Facebook's attempt to capture even more data from its messaging subsidiary, WhatsApp, which it acquired for around $US16 billion in 2014 but hasn't been able to monetise. That forced the company into two backflips: it delayed the planned February change to 15 May, then <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/05/whatsapp-wont-limit-functionality-if-you-dont-accept-its-controversial-new-privacy-policy/">last week</a> it announced that "we will not limit the functionality of how WhatsApp works for those who have not yet accepted the update".</p><p>In other words, WhatsApp users will still have to opt-in for Facebook to have access to their WhatsApp images and metadata (WhatsApp is <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/dont-backup-your-conversations/">likely</a> end-to-end encrypted so the messages themselves are useless), limiting the number of users it can data mine.</p><p>The second blow was Apple's IOS 14.5 update, which starting rolling out to users in late April:</p><blockquote>Since the update went live last month iPhone owners have been opting out of data tracking in their droves. According to Flurry Analytics, 85 per cent of worldwide users clicked 'ask app not to track' when prompted, with the proportion rising to 94 per cent in the US.</blockquote><p>Now to be clear, Apple is no saint. It has been accused of <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/seven-apple-suppliers-accused-of-using-forced-labor-from-xinjiang">using forced labour</a> in Xinjiang and has been more than willing to sell its Chinese users <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">down the river</a>:</p><blockquote>Mr. Cook [Apple CEO] often talks about Apple's commitment to civil liberties and privacy. But to stay on the right side of Chinese regulators, his company has put the data of its Chinese customers at risk and has aided government censorship in the Chinese version of its App Store. After Chinese employees complained, it even dropped the "Designed by Apple in California" slogan from the backs of iPhones.</blockquote><p>Apple's attack on Facebook via the data tracking opt-out is not an act of benevolence but a strategic move designed to cripple a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html">major competitor</a>. If Facebook can't track Apple iPhone users (<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/27/there-are-1b-iphones-in-use-worldwide-apple-says">over 1 billion in use worldwide</a>), it can't sell targeted adverts to them as easily. How can Facebook continue to pump development dollars into the likes of WhatsApp if they can't be monetised?</p><p>The short answer is it can't, which is why Facebook has a data problem. In an effort to offset Apple's move, Facebook recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/zuckerberg-facebook-may-be-in-stronger-position-after-apple-ios-14.html">increased</a> the number of internal commerce products it offers, such as Facebook Shops and Instagram Shops ('other' revenue in the chart above). It has also been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking">begging Apple users</a> to "show you ads that are more personalised", to "keep Facebook free of charge".</p><p>But would anyone actually pay for Facebook? 🤔 </p>]]></content:encoded>

A surge in raw material prices spurred pledges to increase domestic supply, toughen market oversight, and crack down on speculation and hoarding. <br><br>The rapid gains are challenging the central bank's ability to restrain inflation without hiking borrowing costs or making a sharp turn in monetary policy – something the People's Bank of China has said it will avoid. The risk is the government's attempts to curb price increases won’t be enough, forcing the central bank's hand at a vulnerable time for domestic consumption.</blockquote><p>Bubbles – particularly in assets – are blowing up everywhere, not just in China. Demand surged on the back of record-low interest rates and gargantuan fiscal stimulus in response to the coronavirus pandemic, despite the fact that it was a supply shock, not a deep demand shock (as after, say, a financial crisis).</p><p>There is a reasonable risk that the observed asset price inflation eventually flows through to consumer price inflation, forcing rate hikes and a destruction of company valuations. It's already showing up in China's <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61ca6a81-4126-40d0-aa25-225d67e2b8d3">producer prices</a> – the price of raw materials and goods leaving its factories – which will squeeze the margins of consumer goods vendors, unless they also start to raise prices.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/china-calm-bond-markets.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="China's bond market isn't concerned about inflation." loading="lazy" width="620" height="348" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/china-calm-bond-markets.jpg 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/china-calm-bond-markets.jpg 620w"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-22/bubble-risks-test-china-s-commitment-to-no-sharp-turn-in-policy">Bloomberg</a></figcaption></figure><p>While China's financial markets are "pricing in a relatively benign scenario", and the "10-year government bond yield has fallen to the lowest level in eight months", it's important to remember that bond markets <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/bond-yields-are-not-good-predictors-inflation">have never</a> actually predicted future inflation but instead move concurrently with inflation, sometimes even with a lag<em>.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/bonds-inflation-history.png" class="kg-image" alt="There is no evidence to suggest that bond markets are good predictors of inflation." loading="lazy" width="973" height="900" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/bonds-inflation-history.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/bonds-inflation-history.png 973w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/bond-yields-are-not-good-predictors-inflation">Peterson Institute for International Economics</a></figcaption></figure><p>We made a prediction of sorts back in <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/it-has-been-a-long-five-months/">December 2020</a>:</p><blockquote>Central bankers have been very vocal about suppressing interest rates for, in some cases, up to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-03/rba-cuts-interest-rates-record-low-coronavirus-pandemic/12838760">three years</a>. Whether they'll be able to achieve that stated goal is another question, but you can be sure they'll try for far longer than they should. <br><br>But the sheer amount of demand stimulus being injected into the global economy can't go on forever and when it turns, it'll turn quickly. As Hemingway wrote in The Sun Also Rises, you go bankrupt in two ways: "Gradually, then suddenly." That's probably how the latest global debt adventure will also unfold: first with asset price inflation, then with the wealth effect pushing up consumer price inflation, then finally with a sudden crisis as markets, central bankers and governments eventually realise their errors (far too late). <br><br>Unfortunately, the madness may continue for much longer than you expect (such is the nature of credit booms).</blockquote><p>Asset price inflation, check. We're now starting to see some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/12/us-consumer-prices-soar-high-2008-inflation">consumer price inflation</a> – which central banks are claiming is "transitory" – but there's still pressure to come given that the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT">savings rate</a> remains elevated and <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPSACBW027SBOG">growth in bank deposits</a> only started to decelerate in mid-March.</p><p>However, supply chains are already under pressure from COVID-restrictions and the swathe of order cancellations last year and subsequent investment and production cuts mean prices could respond relatively quickly to additional consumer demand.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/google-trends-inflation-may-2021.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google searches for inflation are back where they were during the global financial crisis." loading="lazy" width="1119" height="319" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/google-trends-inflation-may-2021.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/google-trends-inflation-may-2021.png 1000w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/google-trends-inflation-may-2021.png 1119w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=inflation">Google Trends</a></figcaption></figure><p>We don't pretend to know when the music will stop but the recent volatility in equity, commodity and crypto markets, along with rising web searches for inflation, suggests we're not alone in worrying about bubble risks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ABC (an Australian government news organisation) ran an article 'explaining' the global microchip shortage, titled <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-07/what-does-chipageddon-have-to-do-with-climate-change/13327926"><em>What does chipageddon have to do with climate change?</em></a></p><p>As you might have guessed by the title, the authors attribute the global chip shortage – <em>chipageddon</em> – to a drought in Taiwan (its worst for 56 years, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56798308">according to the BBC</a>), which they say "is happening in the context of a changed climate, particularly the extremes". At first glance, that makes sense – chip production requires a lot of water and the ABC cites a <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/60b4/234a6336bb8e8a4d55bca389f5c25c48fdc4.pdf">2012 journal article</a> that concludes climate change will lead to "a rise in drought frequencies" in Taiwan (as well as increased floods).</p><p>There are two major problems with the ABC's article. First, the paper cited only modelled the years 2080 - 2099. It's a bit of a stretch to say the current drought "is happening in the context of a changed climate", then citing a paper that supports that argument by modelling climate change 59 - 78 years into the future.</p><p>But the biggest problem with the article is there's no evidence a lack of water has actually affected Taiwan's chip production. </p><p>Due to the drought, the government <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/taiwan-drought-highlights-water-stress-as-growing-environmental-risk-04-05-2021">has been</a> transporting water from less affected regions for use in technology parks (where most microchip factories operate). So while agricultural crop yields might be damaged due to the lack of typhoons in 2020 (around 70% of water usage in Taiwan is for relatively lower value <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3124623/taiwan-says-it-has-enough-water-keep-chip-makers-humming-amid">agricultural use</a>), microchip manufacturing has so far been spared.</p><p>Don't get me wrong: climate change is something Taiwan's chip producers will have to manage going forward. But it can be managed – Taiwan's biggest issue is not the drought but a <strong>chronic underpricing of water</strong>. Taiwan has the <a href="https://international.thenewslens.com/article/148381">cheapest water in Asia</a> and one of the lowest water prices in the world. That leads to inefficiencies all the way down the supply chain, from wasteful behaviour by households to entire industries being built around artificially cheap water. </p><p>Fix prices, fix the drought.</p><p>As an addendum (because you won't learn much about <em>chipageddon</em> by reading that ABC article), the current chip shortage stems from the combination of the US-China trade dispute disrupting supply chains (Huawei reportedly <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Huawei-crackdown/Huawei-blames-US-for-global-chip-supply-crunch">stockpiled</a> six months' worth of inventory) and a huge miscalculation on behalf of manufacturers around the world. <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/the-great-reopening-will-generate-a-million-identical-stories/">According to</a> Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC, "In March, 2020, as COVID paralysed the US, car sales tumbled, leading automakers to cancel their chip orders. So TSMC stopped making them."</p><p>Global manufactures panicked when the pandemic hit and cancelled their orders. Suppliers stopped producing. Now they're crying shortage because the <a href="https://brekkywrap.com/2021/all-in-on-housing/">rebound</a> in the demand for durable consumer goods has been so intense. Hence, <em>chipageddon</em>.</p><h3 id="the-maher-effect">The Maher effect</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/old-man-bitcoin.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Old man yells at Bitcoin" loading="lazy" width="680" height="514" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/old-man-bitcoin.jpg 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/05/old-man-bitcoin.jpg 680w"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/_benkaufman/status/1388485694155276291">Ben Kaufman/Twitter</a></figcaption></figure><p>Many of you may have seen comedian/talk show host Bill Maher's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaJpYjO136o">hit job</a> on Bitcoin last week. He clearly doesn't understand crypto and makes a lot of mistakes in his analysis, but he <a href="https://twitter.com/PessimistsArc/status/1388651371969253376">tends to do that</a> with everything he doesn't understand:</p><ul><li>On vaccines, "It's presented as this genius medical advancement. No it's actually this risky medical procedure."</li><li>On camera phones, "It's a phone not a Swiss army knife."</li><li>On social media, "I already know what the captain of the football team is doing these days: mowing my lawn."</li><li>On SARS, "Stop scaring us with diseases we will never get... Mysterious Asian diseases don't come knocking on your door."</li><li>On streaming, "I just think people watching other people playing video games is a waste of f**king time."</li></ul><p>However, one valid point he did bring up was Bitcoin's electricity use:</p><blockquote>Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind; just one uses more energy than a million Visa transactions and has the same carbon footprint as 85,000 hours of watching YouTube ... Bitcoin uses more energy than Netflix, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Google combined.</blockquote><p>It's a legitimate concern, but also one that was answered last week by the <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-actually-consume"><em>Harvard Business Review</em></a>:</p><blockquote>In December 2019, <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-december-2019">one report</a> suggested that 73% of Bitcoin’s energy consumption was carbon neutral, largely due to the abundance of hydro power in major mining hubs such as Southwest China and Scandinavia. On the other hand, the CCAF <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/">estimated</a> in September 2020 that the figure is closer to 39%. But even if the lower number is correct, that’s still almost <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php">twice as much</a> as the U.S. grid, suggesting that looking at energy consumption alone is hardly a reliable method for determining Bitcoin’s carbon emissions. <br>... <br>Almost all of the energy used worldwide must be produced relatively close to its end users — but Bitcoin has no such limitation, enabling miners to utilize power sources that are inaccessible for most other applications... Bitcoin miners from <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/energy-giant-equinor-to-cut-gas-flaring-with-bitcoin-mining-tie-up-report">North Dakota</a> to Siberia have seized the opportunity to monetize this otherwise-wasted resource, and <a href="https://www.crusoeenergy.com/emissions-reduction">some companies</a> are even exploring ways to further reduce emissions by combusting the gas in a more controlled manner. <br>... <br>Many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/climate/coinbase-cryptocurrency-energy.html">journalists</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8">academics</a> talk about Bitcoin’s high “per-transaction energy cost,” but this metric is misleading. The vast majority of Bitcoin’s energy consumption happens during the mining process. Once coins have been issued, the energy required to validate transactions is minimal. As such, simply looking at Bitcoin’s total energy draw to date and dividing that by the number of transactions doesn’t make sense — most of that energy was used to mine Bitcoins, not to support transactions. <br>... <br>Because Bitcoin's energy footprint has grown so rapidly, people sometimes assume that it will eventually commandeer entire energy grids... [However,] the energy mix of Bitcoin grows less reliant on carbon every year... [and] miners are unlikely to continue expanding their mining operations at the current rates indefinitely. </blockquote><p>TL;DR: Bitcoin's electricity use and environmental impact is "a lot less alarming than you might think".</p><h3 id="merkel-nails-it">Merkel nails it</h3><p>For those who missed it, US President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57004302">jumped on the</a> 'abolish intellectual property (IP) for COVID-19 vaccines' bandwagon last week, "amid pressure from Democrats in his party to remove patent protections". In other words, yet another policy directed at virtue signalling rather than accomplishing anything useful.</p><p>The thing is, IP is not the handbrake on vaccine production and distribution. IP holders have been more than willing to licence it to whomever has, or is willing to develop, manufacturing capacity. Moderna (the creator of one of the two mRNA vaccines) even <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/node/10066/pdf">went so far</a> as to suspend enforcement of its IP way back on 8 October 2020:</p><blockquote>...while the pandemic continues, Moderna will not enforce our COVID-19 related patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic. Further, to eliminate any perceived IP barriers to vaccine development during the pandemic period, upon request we are also willing to license our intellectual property for COVID-19 vaccines to others for the post pandemic period.</blockquote><p>It's not just Moderna, either. All vaccine makers are licencing their products to whomever wants them. Take AstraZeneca, which for all its problems <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-vaccine-ip-debacle-11620341686">has built</a> a supply network with 25 manufacturing organisations in 15 countries to produce three billion doses this year.</p><p>Thankfully the world still has a handful of politicians that possess some common sense. In response to Biden's support of abolishing IP, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (via a spokesperson) <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/merkel-pushes-back-on-vaccine-patent-waiver-in-clash-with-biden">nailed it</a>: </p><blockquote>The US plan would create "severe complications" for the production of vaccines. "The limiting factor for the production of vaccines are manufacturing capacities and high quality standards, not the patents. The protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and this has to remain so in the future.</blockquote><p>If you want to make the 'scarring' from the pandemic even worse, then abolishing vaccine IP would be a great way to do that, as it would undermine the incentive to quickly innovate during the next crisis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be honest, I'm surprised it took <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/china-says-33-apps-break-rules-in-gathering-personal-information">this long</a>:</p><blockquote>China said thirty-three applications, including map navigation software provided by Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., violated regulations, with most collecting personal information that weren’t relevant to their services. <br>... <br>In March, the administration published rules that banned mobile app operators from declining to offer basic services to customers who refuse to provide "unnecessary" personal information, and it vowed to "concretely protect" the rights of internet users. The rules went into effect on Saturday. <br><br>China has started to rein in its internet companies on concerns over their growing influence in every aspect of Chinese life, as well as the vast amounts of data they’ve amassed through providing services like online shopping, chatting and ride-hailing. <br>... <br>The government is also said to have proposed a state-backed venture with some of the country’s biggest e-commerce and payments platforms that would oversee the lucrative data they collect from hundreds of millions of consumers.</blockquote><p>In China, the Communist Party always comes first. The rapid rise of Chinese Big Tech companies appears to have caught President Xi Jinping somewhat by surprise. The establishment – particularly the heavily state-controlled banking and finance sector – was being <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/751c2500-f50d-47c9-8f04-a28ad62285fd">rocked</a> and it was a completely spontaneous, market-driven disruption. Certainly not ideal for a 'centrally planned' economy, and not a good look for Xi Jinping when Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, was being paraded around the world as a capitalist symbol of success in deeply communist China.</p><p>Having cut down tall poppies such as Jack Ma (who has made <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1fe0559f-de6d-490e-b312-abba0181da1f">one public appearance</a> since Xi Jinping was personally involved in the government's cancellation of his planned public offering of Ant Group), the focus is now on regaining control of a new commodity: data.</p><p>Yes, China's government has a 'great firewall' that at least in theory prevents its citizens from being exposed to ideas from the outside world (in reality that's impossible). It also controls most of the domestic scuttlebutt by monitoring and censoring every conversation in essential social apps such as WeChat.</p><p>But where the Communist Party let its guard down was in finance. In the past it was easy: China's banks were all either state owned or private in name only, with the government exercising control over them directly or via the heavy hand of regulation. But with the emergence of Alipay in particular, over half of China's population decided it <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jack-mas-giant-financial-startup-is-shaking-the-chinese-banking-system-1532885367">didn't need</a> to use the traditional banking system as much, and:</p><blockquote>"Once people's money moves from conventional bank accounts into their virtual wallets, much of it doesn't return."</blockquote><p>Given that Alipay was privately owned and operated as a non-bank payment company, it was effectively unregulated. That meant it could out innovate and compete the state-owned banks, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jack-mas-giant-financial-startup-is-shaking-the-chinese-banking-system-1532885367">which</a> "did much of their work with state-owned enterprises, ignoring small firms that could use more capital".</p><p>So here we are. Last week we saw that China's <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/the-future-of-money/">new digital currency</a> was not a disruptor to be feared but a platform upon which the likes of Alipay will soon have to operate. Now there's a "state-backed venture" being considered, which will further tether China's biggest e-commerce and payments platforms to the Communist Party. Xi Jinping will once again be able to track every transaction and exert full control over to whom credit is allocated, with the stated aim of "concretely protecting" the rights of internet users nothing but a facade.</p><p>China's nationalisation of data and the creation of a digital currency are not a risk to dominant fiat currencies such as the US dollar, nor are they a risk to cryptos. If anything, the opposite is true and Xi Jinping should be careful not to suffocate one of the most vibrant sectors in China with his latest power grab.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clubhouse is <em>probably</em> still the latest hot app to come out of Silicon Valley. As I wrote back in <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/not-so-fundamental-rights/">March</a>:</p><blockquote>Clubhouse quickly attracted the who's who of celebrity life, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and even Oprah. It's still invite-only – what fad isn't? – but since day one I've had concerns about its potential longevity.</blockquote><p>Well here I am again, bringing you another story about why Clubhouse – which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">only last week</a> secured Series C funding at a valuation of $US4 billion – could well become vapourware. The inspiration of today's issue was an article by Ed Zitron, with which I generally agree. <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/clubhouse-and-audios-feature-not">Ed notes that</a> Clubhouse "assumes that listening to people talk is fun, and that talking to people entirely on a mobile app is also fun". He continues:</p><blockquote>Twitch succeeded because it created an actual social network that did something truly new, and enabled people to enjoy watching people play games, which is a thing that people do in person and really enjoy doing. What Clubhouse thinks they're doing is recreating the experience of watching a live panel, or a fireside chat, or, indeed, listening to a podcast, when the actual general experience of Clubhouse is more akin to being at a weird party with too many conversations. And frankly, people enjoy watching someone play a game - there are lots of different games and lots of different people to play them. There are only so many voices, only so many subjects, and people only have so much patience to listen to them.</blockquote><p>Do read the <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/clubhouse-and-audios-feature-not">whole thing</a>. Perhaps Ed and I are wrong – perhaps it's my inherent dislike of the very thing Clubhouse is trying to scale, the dreaded conference, that has skewed my view. After all, plenty of people seem to enjoy conferences (or was it always more about the free travel and accommodation?).</p><p>But I just don't see the appeal to what is essentially a permanent, rolling, extremely broad conference with infinite rooms to which I have to listen in real time at normal speed (turning a podcast up to 1.25x speed is a game changer – try it sometime). But outside of the big, heavy hitting Clubhouse events featuring celebrities and other influential persons, who has time to listen to random people dribble on, unfiltered, for hours on end? And if your only real selling point is the occasional appearance by a big name (their time is incredibly scarce/expensive), what does Clubhouse have to offer over any other platform/medium once the venture capital dollars are exhausted and those VIPs stop showing up?</p><p>So I suppose I still don't see the appeal of Clubhouse. To be honest, I'm not really sure it has an appeal, once the celebrity novelty wears off. It's just a directory of live podcasts but with no editing, no way to economise on <em>my</em> time and seemingly few monetisation options in the future. It may not be worthless but I suspect the best case for investors is to be bought out by a desperate Microsoft (which recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-ends-deal-talks-with-microsoft-11618938806">failed to buy</a> an audio business with an actual product and social network, Discord) and rolled into LinkedIn (also owned by Microsoft).</p><h2 id="the-cellebrite-hack">The Cellebrite hack</h2><p><em>The below has been cross-posted from last Friday's <a href="https://brekkywrap.com/2021/a-snag-and-a-vax/">Brekky Wrap</a>.

If Cellebrite can be compromised as easily as Marlinspike suggests, it could open such evidence up to legal challenges and seriously compromise Cellebrite's credibility.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a bit of a perfect storm for Bitcoin (and almost all cryptocurrencies) over the weekend, culminating in rapid double-digit price declines. Bitcoin <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-sunday-18-april-us-treasury-digital-assets-ethereum-litecoin-coinbase-doge-094926937.html">fell almost</a> 15% in 24 hours, Ethereum fell 17% and Litecoin was down some 24%. All have since paired some of those losses but as of Monday, the bitcoin price was still ~10% lower.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/04/btc-price-crash-19-apr-21.png" class="kg-image" alt="Bitcoin's crash." loading="lazy" width="934" height="516" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/btc-price-crash-19-apr-21.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/04/btc-price-crash-19-apr-21.png 934w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The major carnage stemmed from <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-sunday-18-april-us-treasury-digital-assets-ethereum-litecoin-coinbase-doge-094926937.html">a rumour</a> that the US Treasury will soon "tackle financial institutions for money laundering carried out through digital assets". That's a big deal – one reason for Bitcoin's meteoric rise over the past year has been its growing legitimacy, with Mastercard <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/">bringing crypto to its network</a>, crypto exchange Coinbase going public last week, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/18/were-closer-to-a-bitcoin-etf-but-not-all-the-way-there-yet-cio.html">growing talk</a> of bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs), and then <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html">who could forget</a> Elon Musk's $US1.5 billion bitcoin purchase.</p><p>Any moves by the US Treasury to undermine that new-found legitimacy will have a detrimental effect, at least in the short-term, on crypto prices. Let's not forget that Turkey last week banned crypto payments entirely, albeit for different reasons (crypto is a threat to the Turkish lira – Turkey's President, Erdoğan, believes that high interest rates cause inflation and has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/turkeys-lira-plunges-after-erdogan-sacks-central-bank-chief.html">sacked multiple</a> central bank chiefs who have tried to rein in the country's rampant inflation).</p><p>Finally there are the ongoing attacks on crypto – Bitcoin in particular – claiming it's nothing more than an "open Ponzi scheme", most recently by Nassim Taleb (of Black Swan/Antifragile fame). We summarised the argument in yesterday's <a href="https://brekkywrap.com/2021/in-no-hurry/"><em>Brekky Wrap</em></a> (if you haven't signed up, <a href="https://brekkywrap.com/">you should</a> – it's free), which boils down to a misunderstanding of what Bitcoin is: a store of value, not a currency.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/04/taleb-twitter-bitcoin.png" class="kg-image" alt="Taleb's criticism of Bitcoin." loading="lazy" width="600" height="363" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/04/taleb-twitter-bitcoin.png 600w"><figcaption>Taleb's criticism of Bitcoin.</figcaption></figure><p>Bitcoin "doesn't do anything economic" in the same way that the vast majority of the world's gold "doesn't do anything economic". It's a hedge against people like Erdoğan and is a lot easier to store than physical gold. If you're looking for a blockchain that does a lot of "economic" things (smart contracts, non-fungible tokens, etc), that's most likely going to be Ethereum.</p><p>But just because Bitcoin doesn't 'do' anything economic (although there are 'layer 2' developments that might eventually change that) doesn't mean it's "economically equivalent to an open Ponzi scheme".</p><h2 id="regulating-the-competition-away">Regulating the competition away</h2><p>The big Australian banks – CBA, NAB, Westpac and ANZ – are growing <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/bank-bosses-call-for-clear-crypto-regulation-20210418-p57k6x">increasingly frustrated</a> at financial innovation that threatens to undermine their monopoly rents:</p><blockquote>Last week’s Coinbase float put bitcoin on the radar of the parliamentary committee overseeing the major banks for the first time and National Australia Bank CEO Ross McEwan responded on Friday by urging policy makers to set out a plan to protect investors who trade digital assets. <br><br>"We need to think, as a country, [about] what is crypto, how could it be used, and do you trade it – if it is something that should be traded – safely, and so we make it safe. Those are the issues we need to think about – and quite quickly – because people are making a livelihood out of trading cryptocurrencies."</blockquote><p>Australian banks are protected but also handcuffed by the implicit backing of the federal government and central bank and many layers of costly regulation. That limits their ability to take risks and innovate, which is why they're only now talking crypto some 12 years after it was invented. They also recently woke up to a more imminent threat – the popularity of <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/time-for-bnpl-regulation-has-arrived-comyn-20210415-p57jgg">buy now, pay later</a>:</p><blockquote>"I acknowledge the work and innovation [Afterpay has] undertaken to build such large and successful company – and avoiding all of that regulation is quite a feat," Mr Comyn [CBA CEO] said. <br>...<br>"I would suggest the line around innovation in this area is skewed to a complete absence and lack of regulation in a number of areas," he said. <br><br>"The government does and should have a posture towards new players to facilitate and encourage innovation, but my point is based on size and scale – they are beyond the point where the legislation framework that applies to that sector needs to be comprehensively reviewed."</blockquote><p>Buy now, pay later is eroding banks' interest margins and non-interest income from credit cards, which is basically a heavily regulated version of the former. Buy now, pay later is not so much an 'innovation' in the truest sense of the word – it's an innovation in regulatory arbitrage, or an ability to exploit a loophole the banks didn't see until it was too late.</p><p>I suspect it won't be long until regulators come down hard on buy now, pay later. The banks have too much influence in Canberra and there's too much at stake in terms of <em><a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/time-for-bnpl-regulation-has-arrived-comyn-20210415-p57jgg">perceived</a></em> financial stability:</p><blockquote>"We see roughly buy now, pay later users having twice as much credit on their credit facilities, and typically on their credit cards [and] they have more credit products," Mr Comyn [CBA CEO] said. "That is what we can see. But a number of buy now, pay later providers don't contribute to 'comprehensive credit reporting'."</blockquote><p>The knives are out and if regulators decide to burden the likes of Afterpay with even a fraction of the existing banking regulation it will hurt their profitability (added costs) and growth potential (less differentiation from traditional credit cards). Tread carefully.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China has a digital currency. Or more precisely, the People's Bank of China (PBOC – its central bank) <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-creates-its-own-digital-currency-a-first-for-major-economy-11617634118">has a digital currency</a>, the e-CNY: </p><blockquote>A thousand years ago, when money meant coins, China invented paper currency. Now the Chinese government is minting cash digitally, in a re-imagination of money that could shake a pillar of American power. <br>...<br>Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have foreshadowed a potential digital future for money, though they exist outside the traditional global financial system and aren't legal tender like cash issued by governments. <br><br>China's version of a digital currency is controlled by its central bank, which will issue the new electronic money. It is expected to give China's government vast new tools to monitor both its economy and its people. By design, the digital yuan will negate one of bitcoin's major draws: anonymity for the user.</blockquote><p>There has been a lot of fearmongering surrounding the news (it's not actually news – the PBOC has been working on a digital currency since <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-21/chinese-central-bank-studies-prospect-of-own-digital-currency">at least 2014</a>) – including from the influential Niall Ferguson and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/peter-thiel-calls-bitcoin-a-chinese-financial-weapon-at-virtual-roundtable">Peter Thiel</a>.</p><p>Writing for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-04/don-t-let-china-mint-the-digital-currency-of-the-future">Bloomberg</a>, Ferguson worries that:</p><blockquote>Not only are the American monetary authorities underestimating the threat posed to dollar dominance by China’s pioneering combination of digital currency and electronic payments. They are also treating the blockchain-based financial innovations that offer the best alternative to China’s e-yuan like gatecrashers at their own exclusive party.</blockquote><p>Ferguson rightly points out that blockchain-based financial innovations are a threat to governments and central banks – cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are indeed "stateless money". And he's right that one of China's motivations for moving into the digital space is to one day usurp the mighty US dollar.</p><p>However, he quickly veers off course, drawing the bold conclusion that China has <em>got it right</em> – that "the future of money... [will arrive] in the form of a widely adopted e-CNY", all while the US twiddles its thumbs:</p><blockquote>This new Chinese system not only defends the CCP against the twin threats of crypto and big tech, while ensuring that all Chinese citizens' transactions are under surveillance; it also includes an offensive capability to challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance in cross-border payments.</blockquote><p>Ferguson assumes far too much in terms of both the outlook for China's new digital currency and its threat to the US dollar's hegemony. This is a country that, while large, has a GDP per capita only marginally above Kazakhstan – i.e. it's poor. In terms of wealth, China is about where Japan was in 1985 – which, coincidentally, was around when American economists were <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4050">worried</a> about "a growing role for the yen, at the expense of the [US] dollar".</p><p>It was also when influential US government officials, <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF022/14301-9781451953220/14301-9781451953220/14301-9781451953220_A017.xml">such as</a> Treasury Secretaries Blumenthal, Baker and Bentson, "suggested that the dollar was too high against the yen... [and] attempts to talk the dollar down were accompanied by intense trade negotiations aimed at forcing the Japanese to open or share this or that market".</p><p>If that all sounds very familiar, it should. It's exactly what the US government has been attempting for the past 4 years – just replace Japan with China and yen with yuan.</p><p>Back then, people were also <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4050">worried</a> about a 'Yen Bloc' that Japan was forming in the Asia Pacific. <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3122924/beijing-exploring-digital-yuan-cross-border-payments-joining-hong-kong">Now, it's</a> "the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge, a project exploring cross-border payments using distributed ledgers... [a] step towards Beijing's long-term goal of internationalising the yuan at the expense of the US dollar".</p><p>As we all now know, the fears about Japan's yen displacing the US dollar in the 80s were unfounded. But maybe you think it'll be different this time around because, as Ferguson notes, China's government now has a big, scary weapon called a <em>digital currency </em>(something the Japanese could only imagine),<em> </em>while the US Federal Reserve has sat back with a "What me, worry?" approach.</p><p>Allow me to allay your fears – all one has to do is take a quick look at the information we have available on China's new digital currency – or rather, don't have – to realise it's unlikely to become dominant outside of China.</p><p>For one, we don't even know if it's blockchain based. That means we have no idea if it's secured by proof of stake, proof of work, or privately (i.e. authoritatively). However, the odds that China opts for proof of stake (e.g. Cardano, Stellar) or proof of work (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum) are low, because to do so the e-CNY would have to have to be somewhat public and decentralised (i.e. censorship-resistant). Those words don't exist in China's vocabulary.</p><p>If it's blockchain-based – that's a big <strong>IF</strong> – it's probably going to be private and centralised. In other words, it'll be exactly the same as the existing CNY, only more efficient from the government's point view (spying on its people). If anything, the PBOC's national digital currency would be a blow to Alipay and WeChat Pay, not the US dollar. To use Ferguson's own words:</p><blockquote>In 2020, some 58% of Chinese used mobile payments, up from 33% in 2016, and mobile payments accounted for nearly two-thirds of all personal consumption PBOC payments. Banknotes and credit cards have largely yielded to QR codes on smartphones.</blockquote><p>China is already digital. The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-alibaba-instant-view-idUSKBN2BX029">problem is</a>, from the Chinese government's point of view, is that most of the transaction data are held by large private companies run by 'capitalist' billionaires. Moving transactions to a government-controlled private blockchain solves the problem of the private sector's growing financial influence without completely dismantling what they've built.</p><p>Hyman Minsky famously <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Stabilizing-Unstable-Economy-Hyman-Minsky/dp/0071592997">claimed</a> that "everyone can create money; the problem is to get it accepted". China can force its own people to accept its new e-CNY, but it can't force anyone else. To an outsider, the new e-CNY offers no advantages over the existing CNY (more data and control for the Chinese government, yaayyy...). It will not be the "future of money", nor will it come close to challenging the US dollar's global dominance in global financial transactions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Westpac, one of Australia's 'big four' banking giants, has <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/westpac-expands-banking-as-a-service-diverging-from-cba-strategy-20210326-p57eau">started</a> renting out its licence to "allow banking outsiders to provide banking services in competition with Westpac and other banks". Not to be confused with SaaS (software as a service), BaaS – 'banking as a service' – is all the rage in Australia, as it's one of the few financial frontiers where competition is permitted.</p><p>However, that's a generous use of the word 'competition', as:</p><blockquote>The emerging wholesale fintech strategy is a big strategic bet by Westpac that it will be able to win deposits – and ultimately mortgage referrals – from start-ups seeking to embed financial services into their applications. Westpac has decided getting exposure to the trend is worth the risk of giving up customer engagement to the technology players.</blockquote><p>The emergence of 'buy now, pay later' providers such as Afterpay, which capitalised on regulatory arbitrage to carve out a niche not currently served by the incumbents, caught the banks by surprise. One reason is because Australian banks, due to their large size and heavily regulated existence, tend to gravitate towards bureaucratic, centralised and risk-averse decision-making, which can inhibit productivity-enhancing innovation.</p><p>By renting out their banking licence while handling the more bureaucratic functions internally (such as appeasing regulators), banks may be able to have their cake and eat it too. More risk-tolerant firms can try – some might fail, but that's the idea – to innovate on customer-facing banking services inside their own apps, with no risk to the solvency of the bank or Australian financial system. Interestingly, Australia's largest bank – CBA – "is investing heavily in its own technology to enhance personalisation of its app and engagement with its own customers". It'll be interesting to see how that works out.</p><p>Note that none of this is particularly revolutionary but any consumer-welfare improvement in banking, no matter how small, is welcome.</p><h2 id="facebook-hacked-in-2019">Facebook hacked... in 2019</h2><p>The personal data of 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries – including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/mark-zuckerberg-phone-number-facebook-leak-data-reports-2021-4">the Zuck</a> himself – <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">was published</a>, for free, "in a low level hacking forum on Saturday":</p><blockquote>It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and – in some cases – email addresses. <br>... <br>While a couple of years old, the leaked data could provide valuable information to cybercriminals who use people’s personal information to impersonate them or scam them into handing over login credentials, according to Alon Gal, CTO of cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock, who first discovered the entire trough of leaked data online on Saturday.</blockquote><p>You should assume that if you use Facebook, nothing you give it is ever private. If it hasn't been stolen from Facebook's servers, Facebook has probably sold it far and wide enough that it may as well have been.</p><p>If you're concerned, type your Facebook email address into <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com</a> to find out if you were part of the hack.</p><h2 id="welcome-to-the-peoples-republic-of-australia">Welcome to the People's Republic of Australia</h2><p>The Morrison government is really starting to flex its totalitarian tendencies. Not content with forcing the likes of Google and Facebook to pay a convoluted cross-subsidy to their legacy media mates <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/think-of-the-children/">disguised</a> as a 'link tax', they're now "<a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/security/government-considering-100-points-of-id-to-get-facebook-tinder-account/news-story/624550c621d662da7d3bd98ff3f0e888">considering</a> forcing users of social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram — as well as online dating platforms like Tinder — to upload 100 points of identification in order to use them":</p><blockquote>In a nutshell, it would remove the anonymity for those who use such platforms to bully, harass or intimidate other users. <br><br>But it would also mean social media giants — many of which have suffered serious privacy breaches in the past — are holding even more precious information about its users.</blockquote><p>Thankfully, this one will not pass the pub test. The government got away with the fake link tax because it stuck with the crony capitalist playbook, keeping the benefits visible and concentrated with the costs opaque and disperse. However, requiring 100 points of identification to use social media has no benefits other than the usual 'think of the children' <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/think-of-the-children/">fallacy</a>, with very real and visible costs to every social media user – i.e. most Australians.</p><p>Talk about misreading the crowd – the social media backlash was swift, with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sovietscott&amp;src=typed_query">#SovietScott</a> trending on Twitter shortly after the news broke.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook, through prepared remarks delivered by Mark Zuckerberg, said it wants Section 230 – the part of the US <em>Communications Decency Act 1996</em> that protects platforms from the content its users upload – to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-03-25/zuckerberg-lowers-facebook-s-legal-shield-will-other-tech-ceos-follow">be changed</a>:</p><blockquote>Instead of automatically being granted immunity, platforms should have to show they have adequate systems in place for identifying unlawful content and removing it. A "third party" would decide what constitutes an adequate system and it would be "proportionate to platform size," suggesting smaller companies with less money would have easier standards to meet.</blockquote><p>Facebook <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/25/social-media-companies-are-outsourcing-their-dirty-work-philippines-generation-workers-is-paying-price/">already employs</a> around 30,000 'content reviewers', more than any other platform (Google/YouTube employ about 10,000, Twitter just 1,500). You can bet your bottom dollar that Facebook will already comply with whatever becomes the definition of an adequate system "proportionate to platform size".</p><p>There are many, many unanswered questions about how the thresholds would be determined, given Facebook ≠ Twitter ≠ YouTube ≠ some new potentially disruptive platform. Platforms come in many different shapes and sizes – will Facebook's proposed change also apply to eCommerce platforms such as Shopify? What about blogging platforms such as Wordpress? Or newsletter platforms such as Substack? It could even affect messaging platforms including encrypted, open source services such as Signal. What about the Fediverse, a federated, decentralised collection of publishing platforms, many of which are operated by a single person?</p><p>The only certainty is that amending Section 230 to include some kind of third party arbitrator mandating 'adequate systems', i.e. higher costs, to any 'platform' (however defined), would further entrench Facebook's status as the <em>de facto</em> social media platform.</p><p>But if you're after more regulation then never fear, for the UK's Competition &amp; Markets Authority is <a href="https://twitter.com/CMAgovUK/status/1375043675697332227">on the job</a>:</p><blockquote>We've found that Facebook's completed purchase of Giphy raises competition concerns in relation to digital advertising and the supply of GIFs.</blockquote><p>Is there nothing more important to be doing than writing papers on "competition concerns in relation to... the supply of GIFs". Really? REALLY? Tax dollars well spent. Sigh. 🤦‍♂️</p><h3 id="australias-news-bargaining-chip">Australia's 'news bargaining chip'</h3><p>Alan Kohler <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2021/03/17/alan-kohler-news-bargaining-code-dead/">laid out</a> what has become of Australia's news media bargaining code, of which we have been highly critical (see <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/whats-a-google/">here</a> and <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/facebook-strikes-back-as-google-folds/">here</a>):</p><blockquote>Mr Morrison and Mr Frydenberg were standing behind the publishers with bulging tattooed arms folded and cauliflower ears, while their cigar-smoking bosses said: “Nice businesses you’ve got there. Pity if something were to happen to them”. <br>... <br>But why are the victims of this shakedown – Google and Facebook – happy to be coughing up? <br><br>Because their core operations of Google search and Facebook news feed have been quarantined and their monopoly rents untouched. <br><br>Google is paying publishers to appear in “News Showcase”, which is a very hard-to-find separate website, and Facebook is paying for “Facebook News” which doesn’t exist, but when it does it will also be off to the side.</blockquote><p>None of that is surprising. In economic terms, this is a textbook case of rent seeking, with the Australian government – remember, the Treasurer is best buds with Ryan Stokes, son of the billionaire boss of Seven West Media, which greatly benefited from this code – succumbing to a strong lobbying effort from a large, politically influential industry. But what was surprising was the frankness of Rod Sims, the Chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC):</p><blockquote>"It doesn't matter a toss what the money is paid for", [said Sims]. <br><br>At an on-the-record Q&amp;A event in Melbourne last week, Mr Sims said: "For reasons of their own, Google and Facebook strongly don't want to pay for news on search and news feed. Fine. The news media companies don't care what the money is for. So I just think it's a perfect outcome." <br>... <br>"The problem we're addressing with the news media code is simply that we wanted to arrest the decline in money going to journalism. That's what the code is about – getting more money into journalism, and I personally think the money going into Seven and Nine, what's been publicly reported, which is north of $30 million, will make a big difference."</blockquote><p>So the government worked with the regulator and media companies to concoct some fantastical justification for a 'link tax' for no other reason than to siphon off a bit of Google and Facebook's revenue to subsidise said media companies, presumably so the government could avoid the uncomfortable position of trying justifying the subsidy to the electorate.</p><p>It was a good old fashioned shake-down, nothing more, nothing less. The attitude of Rod Sims is particularly disturbing, as his comments make it appear as though his agency was completely captured by the legacy media companies (how does an arbitrarily determined – the power to 'designate' a company is at the Treasurer's discretion – heavily interventionist and intellectually dubious cross-subsidy "<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/australian-competition-consumer-commission/about-the-accc">strengthen and supplement competitive market processes</a>", exactly?).</p><p>Kohler finishes with:</p><blockquote>The News Bargaining Code now sits on a shelf waiting for these three-year deals to come up for renewal, when presumably it will be taken down and waved around a bit to make sure the deals are, in fact, renewed.</blockquote><p>In other words, Facebook and Google must now pay a ransom to a few billionaire owners of local media conglomerates every 3 years or get out of Australia. No doubt Australia's Treasurer, Josh Friedenberg, will have a cushy job waiting for him at Seven West Media when he's eventually bounced from Parliament. Well played.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It <a href="https://www.imy.se/other-lang/in-english/the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/the-purposes-and-scope-of-the-general-data-protection-regulation/">turns out that an</a> "individuals' fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly their right to protection of their personal data", are not so fundamental after all.</p><p>Hypocrisy aside, this is yet another reason not to use any 'encrypted' service that isn't open source, such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. They may well be encrypted but you can never be sure the cryptographic keys haven't been handed over to some authority, somewhere. If there's a backdoor it also means there's a vulnerability: it's only a matter of time before some bureaucrat is socially engineered or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/02/cabinet-files-prime-ministers-department-admits-it-lost-secret-papers">simply throws out</a> an old computer with the keys on it.</p><h3 id="googles-privacy-theatre">Google's privacy theatre</h3><p>Google plans to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333848/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-complaint-chrome-privacy">phase out cookies</a>. No, not the delicious dessert but third-party tracking 'cookies' collected by an individual's browser. Fewer cookies means less tracking which means more privacy... which is good, right? Wrong:</p><blockquote>For years, Google has been gradually scaling back its use of tracking cookies, announcing earlier this month that it will not establish an alternate system for tracking users on the web. But critics of the company — including the Electronic Frontier Foundation — have criticized those efforts as self-serving.</blockquote><p>As usual, the 'do no evil' company has ulterior motives. Cookies are usable by anyone and serve an important purpose, such as helping you stay signed into websites or tracking referrals. Instead of using cookies to track people, Google will now do it directly in Chrome, making advertisers even <em>more </em>dependent on Google.</p><p>You see, its internet browser – Chrome – has a dominant market share close to 65%:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/03/browser-market-share-jan-21.png" class="kg-image" alt="Global market share held by leading internet browsers" loading="lazy" width="702" height="482"></figure><p>Moving away from cookies will hurt Google's competitors far more than Google itself. It's a self-serving move dressed up as altruism. If you use Chrome, consider switching to Firefox (with the uBlock Origin add-on)!</p><h3 id="the-clubhouse-fad">The Clubhouse fad</h3><p>You may have heard of the latest craze in Silicon Valley, <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a>:</p><blockquote>Clubhouse is a new type of social network based on voice—where people around the world come together to talk, listen and learn from each other in real-time.</blockquote><p>Backed by big hitting venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Clubhouse quickly attracted the who's who of celebrity life, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and even <a href="https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a34376747/what-is-clubhouse-social-media-app/">Oprah</a>. It's still invite-only – what fad isn't? – but since day one I've had concerns about its potential longevity.</p><p>For instance, celebrities are busy and their time is <em>not </em>cheap. Are they really going to deliver live content day-in, day-out, once the 'new kid on the block' effect wanes? Throw in some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/20/why-hot-new-social-app-clubhouse-spells-nothing-but-trouble">Facebook-level privacy</a> issues and it went straight into my scrap heap.</p><p>Building on that concern, Shaan Puri recently stormed a <a href="https://twitter.com/shaanvp/status/1371972261004070913">long twitter thread</a> hypothesising about how Clubhouse might evolve (do read the whole thing). The oft-made comparisons to Twitch – a live game streaming service – were particularly interesting, as the comparisons are flawed:</p><blockquote>1 - twitch creators are live ~40 hours a week. Our best creators do weekly shows. ~3-4 hrs a week max. The game makes content creation easier<br> <br>2 - Twitch is vertically focused (gaming). Clubhouse is horizontal.  You need "great content" across EVERY category.<br><br>3 - On Clubhouse, if you join a convo 45 minutes late, you missed the best talking points and might be lost.   But with Twitch, the "game stores the context". No matter when I join, I look at the game and I know what the player is doing.  So it's "live" but not "urgent".</blockquote><p>Puri predicts Clubhouse will evolve into a place to "chill", essentially a "<a href="https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1371972361772220417">Discord for Douchebags</a>". No thanks.</p><h3 id="huawei-patent-troll">Huawei, patent troll</h3><p>With its hardware now banned in many parts of the world, Huawei is pivoting into <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/huawei-to-start-demanding-5g-royalties-from-smartphone-giants">patent royalties</a>:</p><blockquote>Huawei Technologies Co. will begin charging mobile giants like Apple Inc. a “reasonable” fee for access to its trove of wireless 5G patents, potentially creating a lucrative revenue source by showcasing its global lead in next-generation networking. <br>...<br>Huawei will be flexible in negotiating rates on different 5G products -- everything from water meters to smart cars, according to Ding. “One thing for certain is that the $2.50 cap is set on smartphones,” he said.</blockquote><p>Huawei's smartphone market share fell from around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271496/global-market-share-held-by-smartphone-vendors-since-4th-quarter-2009/">20% at the start of 2020</a> to below 10% by the end of the year, following pressure from the United States to ban phones and other hardware made by the company as part of its trade dispute with China. The company had to do <em>something</em>, and that appears to be a doubling down on research and development – and the potentially lucrative royalties that may entail.</p><p>The stated goal of the trade war was <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/huawei-go-again/">national security</a>. In reality, it was a revival of long-discredited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism">mercantilism</a> thinking to bring manufacturing back to the United States – 'Make America Great Again'. It achieved neither: the United States' trade deficit <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html">widened</a>, Huawei's hardware was replaced by hardware produced by different companies (a lot in China!), and China's move towards the development of advanced technology and independence from the United States was accelerated.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/03/us-trade-deficit-jan-21.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The US trade deficit just keeps growing." loading="lazy" width="1290" height="792"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

It was a similar story in Australia, with the 52-year old Prime Minister Scott Morrison <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/coronavirus-vaccine-rollout-pfizer-shots-land-in-sydney-melbourne-queensland-adelaide/5ecc12e7-a470-4541-a045-983f8b3528b5">opting for the Pfizer</a> vaccine to "by my own example today... to say to you, Australians, it's safe, it's important".</p><p>Bu*****t. If Morrison was actually interested in showing Australians it was safe and important and not just selfish queue jumping, he would have opted for the AstraZeneca vaccine, given the public trepidation surrounding it and the fact it's what his government decreed the majority of Australians will receive.</p><p>To be clear, the evidence suggests while the AstraZeneca vaccine is less efficacious than Pfizer or Moderna, it is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-vaccin-idUKKBN2B60L6">perfectly safe</a> (about 30 incidents from a group of around five million, which could just as easily be explained by bad luck). But politicians could not have done a worse job at conveying that information if they tried.</p><h3 id="space-sovereignty">Space sovereignty</h3><p>Space sovereignty is going to become a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-satellite-japan-excl-idUSKBN2B41O1">bigger issue</a> in the very near future, with the rise of companies such as <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/musks-starlink-chinas-tech-crackdown-summers-on-the-stimulus-yglesias-on-s230/">SpaceX's Starlink</a>:</p><blockquote>Myanmar's first satellite is being held on board the International Space Station following the Myanmar coup, while Japan's space agency and a Japanese university decide what to do with it.  <br><br>The $15 million satellite was built by Japan’s Hokkaido University in a joint project with Myanmar’s government-funded Myanmar Aerospace Engineering University (MAEU).

Some companies had previously received licenses that allowed them to keep shipping components to Huawei that the Chinese company may have then used in 5G equipment, while other companies were already subject to tighter restrictions.</blockquote><p>The unintended consequences of the US administration's war against Chinese tech – Huawei in particular – are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chip-shortage-qualcomm-idUSKBN2B32OO">already emerging</a>, with Qualcomm "struggling to keep up with demand for its processor chips used in smartphones and gadgets":</p><blockquote>Demand for Qualcomm's chips has soared in the past months as Android phone makers seek to win over customers abandoning phones produced by Huawei Technologies Co Ltd due to U.S. sanctions. Qualcomm has found it hard to meet this higher-than-expected demand, in part due to a shortage of some subcomponents used in its chips.</blockquote><p>In time, supply chains will adjust.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's not just <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/do-you-like-solar-companies/">cryptocurrencies, houses and equities</a>. Venture capital (VC) has also gone ballistic, fuelled by record low interest rates and stimulus as <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/cant-get-more-crazy-series-a-valuations-extend-record-rise">far as the eye can see</a>:</p><blockquote>A record amount of VC dry powder is propelling prices higher. VC funds amassed $70.9 billion last year as low interest rates and a sharp rebound in tech stocks attracted institutional investors looking to back the next Airbnb or Zoom. The cash surplus means young companies, particularly in hot sectors like fintech and social media, are raising a similar amount for Series A rounds as they might have in the past but at higher valuations. <br>... <br>These deals demonstrate how venture investors are increasingly willing to overlook some conventional growth benchmarks like sales or even user growth. When Andreessen Horowitz won a competitive deal to lead the Series A round for social audio app Clubhouse last year at a $100 million valuation, the app only counted a few thousand users. <br><br>Baked into these high prices are investor expectations that users and eventually revenue will follow.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/03/startup-funding-mar2021.png" class="kg-image" alt="Startup pre-investment valuations are at record highs" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="579" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/startup-funding-mar2021.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/startup-funding-mar2021.png 1000w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/03/startup-funding-mar2021.png 1030w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) released its March 2021 <em><a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2103a.htm">Quarterly Review</a></em> last week. It noted that:</p><blockquote>Such [low] interest rates reduce corporates' debt servicing costs and encourage economic activity, thus leading to higher expected profits and ultimately higher equity valuations. Moreover, if low interest rates are the symptom of accommodative monetary policy that seeks to reduce the likelihood of steep losses on the equity market, then they would go hand in hand with low risk premia and, thus, high valuations. Overall, to the extent that corporate profitability and investors' attitude to risk are predicated on monetary policy, stock valuations would respond strongly to news about this policy.</blockquote><p>With interest rates at zero and 'accommodative monetary policy' expected to continue indefinitely, virtually any valuation can be justified. Combine that with <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/total-stimulus-for-the-covid-19-crisis-already-triple-that-for-the-entire-2008-09-recession">gigantic fiscal stimulus</a> and you get a recipe for disaster when the fiscal impulse eventually fades at the same time as economies open up post-coronavirus and inflation starts threatening those lofty valuations.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/03/mckinsey-2020-stimulus.png" class="kg-image" alt="Global stimulus as at June 2020." loading="lazy" width="800" height="677" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/mckinsey-2020-stimulus.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/03/mckinsey-2020-stimulus.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>As at June 2020.

As of Saturday morning, the highest offer for Dorsey’s tweet was $2 million, from tech entrepreneur Justin Sun. By Saturday evening, the high bid was $2.5 million.</blockquote><p>Remember CryptoKitties? This is basically the same concept, with people buying and selling "a digital certificate of the tweet, unique because it has been signed and verified by the creator".</p><p>Now buying a tweet is silly – all you're getting is bragging rights from your Silicon Valley buddies (which is apparently worth a few mil to these people). The company known as Twitter Inc still owns the tweet. However, blockchain-based NFTs do have real world potential.

When a tax is levied, it has to be paid – but not necessarily by the people or organisations on which it is levied. Frequently new taxes will flow down to consumers through higher prices, which in this case are the businesses that rely on Google for advertising (advertising accounts for the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/">majority of Google's revenue</a>). Those businesses will have to respond either by reducing the amount of advertising they buy or by raising their prices as well.</p><p>France and Spain's 'Google tax' is a tax on their own businesses and consumers – not Google.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone invokes child welfare as the central part of their argument, there's a good chance they're trying to pull a fast one. On Saturday Dennis Shanahan, <em>The Australian's</em> Canberra Bureau Chief, <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/the-facebook-outrage-thats-far-far-worse/news-story/6027b6c9ef6b30063cc7b2404f037470">did exactly that</a> in an attempt to shame Facebook and win over public support for the corporate welfare his employer <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/facebook-strikes-back-as-google-folds/">recently received</a> from the Australian government:</p><blockquote>...tens of thousands of pedophiles used open-source messengers, such as Facebook, to create, sell and share the cruel and sadistic sexual material during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>Children in poor countries are being sold for Bitcoins to satisfy growing numbers of remote sexual abusers who will be able to “go dark” more easily. <br><br>Yet, despite campaigns from advanced countries, national and international police forces, and child protection agencies, Facebook is pressing ahead with plans to provide a cloak of secrecy to such behaviour which it concedes involves thousands of their users. <br>... <br>Allowing subscribers end-to-end encryption — which means people can use the Facebook platform without the existing monitoring and reporting of suspicious behaviour — is the same as its ­attempts to defeat the Australian government’s precedent-setting media bargaining code.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/03/lovejoy-children-simpsons.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Helen Lovejoy, won't you think of the children?" loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/lovejoy-children-simpsons.jpg 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/03/lovejoy-children-simpsons.jpg 640w"></figure><p>People smuggling and child abuse are very real issues. But disallowing Facebook subscribers end-to-end encryption will do very little to help the children. It may not occur to Shanahan or Peter Dutton (Australia's Home Affairs Minister), whom he quotes heavily in the article, but criminals will use end-to-end encryption even if it's not used by Facebook (which is probably why he conveniently omit stats about how many of the "20,000 reports of ­potential child abuse" have actually resulted in convictions).</p><p>If catching paedophiles is your goal, a far more effective method is to use old-fashioned police work, e.g. <a href="http://georgemasonlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/26-1_9-Gregory.pdf">honey pots</a>, which get around the fact that most paedophiles already "use encryption techniques and anonymous networks on the Dark Web to hide their amassed inventory of illegal child abuse images".</p><p>The laws of Australia, <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2018/australias-encryption-gamble/">contrary to the views of former</a> 'techie' Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, do not override the laws of mathematics. If you ban encryption (or mandate a backdoor), you create a vulnerability that exposes every legitimate user to potential harm in exchange for the <em>chance</em> of catching a small number of not-so-bright criminals, effectively violating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio">Blackstone's ratio</a>.</p><p>If Facebook wants to encrypt messaging on its platform – which, contrary to Shanahan's claim, is not open source – that is hardly grounds for "moral suasion, public outcry and consumer pressure". In face, properly implemented end-to-end encryption on Facebook would <em>reduce</em> the amount of data it collects and potentially force Facebook to change its business model from one that puts "profits before people", which is exactly what Shanahan claims he wants!</p><p>The only similarity Facebook's potential move to end-to-end encryption has with the "government’s precedent-setting media bargaining code" is the complete and utter lack of subject matter comprehension displayed by the government and commentators such as Shanahan.</p><h3 id="facebook-sells-out">Facebook sells out</h3><p>Facebook surprised no one last week when it did exactly as predicted, following Google by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/facebook-signs-pay-deals-with-3-australian-news-publishers.html">caving to the Australian government's new media bargaining code</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook announced on Friday preliminary agreements with three Australian publishers, a day after the Parliament passed a law that would make the digital giants pay for news. <br>...<br>Australia’s Parliament on Thursday had passed the final amendments to the so-called News Media Bargaining Code. <br><br>In return for the changes, Facebook agreed to lift a six-day-old ban on Australians accessing and sharing news.</blockquote><p>As I wrote <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/facebook-strikes-back-as-google-folds/">last week</a> [emphasis added]:</p><blockquote>With Facebook no longer posting links to Australian news websites, those people are simply consuming less Australian news. That can't be good for media companies' bottom lines and if the trend continues <strong>it will strengthen Facebook's bargaining power in its ongoing <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/frydenberg-facebook-negotiating-through-the-weekend-on-new-media-laws-20210219-p573zp.html">negotiations</a></strong> with the Australian government. <br>... <br>Corporate welfare, crony capitalism, rent seeking; call it what you will. Everything about this code stinks, but unfortunately Google's capitulation (and <strong>I fully expect Facebook to follow - the Zuck's not one to pass up on a buck</strong>, even if governments clip the ticket on the way through) means this competition-stifling code will soon be exported around the world in various forms.</blockquote><p>The final amendments ensured Facebook could bypass the code by paying off a few large legacy media providers, as Google did the week prior. The sums paid, of course, are confidential and will no doubt be fully tax deductible against their respective Australian earnings.</p><p>So the end result of all this drama is Facebook and Google will remain largely unchanged in Australia, with some of their revenue transferred to a few wealthy Australian media oligarchs, partially paid for by the taxpayer and increased barriers to entry for potential competitors. In other words, the opposite of the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/australian-competition-consumer-commission/about-the-accc">ACCC's mandate</a> of "promoting competition, fair trading and regulating national infrastructure for the benefit of all Australians".</p><p>Bravo.</p><h3 id="when-in-doubt-blame-the-intern">When in doubt, blame the intern</h3><p>News of the <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/neobanks-solarwind-and-the-us-army/">SolarWinds hack</a>, which involved Microsoft and several US bureaucracies including the Treasury, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Department of Energy and even the National Nuclear Security Administration, broke back in December. Following an investigation, executives at the company have thrown <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/26/politics/solarwinds123-password-intern/index.html">an intern under the bus</a>:</p><blockquote>Confronted by Rep. Rashida Tlaib, former SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson said the password issue was "a mistake that an intern made." <br><br>"They violated our password policies and they posted that password on an internal, on their own private Github account," Thompson said. "As soon as it was identified and brought to the attention of my security team, they took that down." <br><br>Neither Thompson nor Ramakrishna [SolarWinds' current CEO] explained to lawmakers why the company's technology allowed for such passwords in the first place.</blockquote><p>This isn't the intern's fault. Any corporation worth its salt will have protocols in place to ensure GitHub passwords are only used in conjunction with public-key authentication, so even if the intern's 'solarwinds123' password was never changed it may not have resulted in any harm (their private key(s) would also need to be compromised).</p><p>I'm one person with zero revenue, not a 2,700-person strong corporation with <a href="https://www.owler.com/company/solarwinds">$US1 billion in revenue</a>, and that's how I authenticate with my servers. Someone should lose their job but it shouldn't be the intern.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to the Australian government's move to push ahead with a slightly <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/media-bargaining-code-amendments-include-a-more-streamlined-algorithm-change-notice/">watered down version</a> of its <em>News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code</em>, Facebook decided the Australian market just <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">wasn't worth the effort</a>:</p><blockquote>The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content. It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter. <br>... <br>Unfortunately, this means people and news organisations in Australia are now restricted from posting news links and sharing or viewing Australian and international news content on Facebook. Globally, posting and sharing news links from Australian publishers is also restricted. To do this, we are using a combination of technologies to restrict news content and we will have processes to review any content that was inadvertently removed.</blockquote><p>For those who need <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/whats-a-google/">a reminder</a>, the media bargaining legislation would require Google and Facebook to pay a few large, politically connected media companies whenever a link to their content is displayed by Google or posted on Facebook - even when the media company posts/promotes the link itself. It is "<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210217/22383446265/bizarre-reaction-to-facebooks-decision-to-get-out-news-business-australia.shtml">fundamentally against the principles of an open internet"</a>; nothing but an old-fashioned shakedown.</p><p>It doesn't take much analysis to show why, either, with the media companies the primary beneficiaries of the existing relationship. Just look at the low value of news to Google and Facebook and the very existence of the entire search engine optimisation industry, where companies pay to get their links closer to the top of Google searches and Facebook feeds. Then there's the question of why media companies post their articles to Facebook - no one is forcing them, just as no one is forcing them to have their pages indexed and displayed by Google. The fact that none of them use a <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/block-indexing">single line of code</a> to prevent Google displaying links to their articles says quite a bit.</p><p>Curiously, Facebook opted to remove all links to Australian news rather than fold like Google did last week, when it <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2021/02/18/facebook-walks-as-google-caves-in-australia">signed</a> a "three-year deal with News Corp [that] will see it hand over an unspecified amount of money to include content from the publisher’s titles... in its News Showcase", thereby avoiding the government's one-sided 'bargaining process' altogether. It's not yet clear whether Facebook's decision was made on principle, commerce (Facebook's statement claims "the business gain from news is minimal"), or some combination of the two, but either way both Google and Facebook now comply with the code.</p><p>Problem solved, right? Wrong.</p><p>While Google has now conceded that it will effectively cut a cheque to every news outlet on the planet to placate their political puppets, Facebook has (so far) opted to defend the principle that no one should have to pay to link to a website. Yes, I know, 'principle' and 'Facebook' are rarely uttered together and I fully expect Facebook to prove me wrong when it does a Google and signs deals with media companies in the coming days or weeks (following through on its threat has given it a much stronger hand in negotiations - more on that below). </p><p>Google's concession and Facebook's exit should be the end of it but no, media pundits and politicians were <strong>furious</strong> that Facebook had refused to pay the government's ransom. How dare it simply walk away! The cronies all came out in force to defend their powerful masters, with all-too-familiar appeals to emotion (and omission of facts):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/02/facebook-commentary.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A small sample from The Australian newspaper." loading="lazy" width="1464" height="469" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/facebook-commentary.jpg 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/facebook-commentary.jpg 1000w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/02/facebook-commentary.jpg 1464w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A small sample from The Australian newspaper.</figcaption></figure><p>Admittedly, Facebook messed up. Rather than compile a database of Australian media sites to filter prior to withdrawing, it opted to use an algorithm that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-facebook-idUSKBN2AI2ZY">accidentally</a> "erased several state government and emergency department accounts, as well as nonprofit charity sites". Machine learning isn't great at the best of times so there were some teething issues, for which Facebook has <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/facebook-exec-apologises-after-aussie-news-ban-blocks-government-and-charity-pages/562a1b29-fec6-4156-b18d-421778dedd03">apologised</a> and resolved (presumably by using humans to white-list the affected sites).</p><p>However, contrary to the wild claims made by many of Australia's politicians and journalists - some even going so far as to claim Facebook was acting like a "<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-18/facebook-acting-like-dictator-with-news-ban-wa-premier-says/13167656">North Korean dictator</a>" - none of those websites were actually 'erased'.

With Facebook no longer posting links to Australian news websites, those people are simply consuming less Australian news. That can't be good for media companies' bottom lines and if the trend continues it will strengthen Facebook's bargaining power in its ongoing <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/frydenberg-facebook-negotiating-through-the-weekend-on-new-media-laws-20210219-p573zp.html">negotiations</a> with the Australian government.</p><p>Long time readers know I'm no fan of Facebook but it is unequivocally in the right here, at least for now.

Instead, Australia's politicians - this legislation has bipartisan support - have fallen prey to legacy media's blatant rent seeking, opting to protect incumbent firms from competition (the beneficiaries of this code are explicitly named, essentially freezing out new content providers) with an opaque, incoherent 'bargaining code' that completely misunderstands the very thing it is supposedly trying to rectify.</p><h3 id="postscript-follow-the-money">Postscript: Follow the money</h3><p>Australia's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg - who is, incidentally, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-19/frydenberg-zuckerberg-meeting-news-media-facebook-ban/13171120">leading the government's negotiations with Facebook</a> - has strong ties to one of the organisations that will benefit the most from this legislation:</p><ul><li>Josh Frydenberg was <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/ryan-stokes-society-wedding-a-sizzler-20161202-gt30re.html">best man</a> at Ryan Stokes’ wedding.</li><li>Ryan Stokes is Kerry Stokes’ son.</li><li>Kerry Stokes owns Seven West Media.</li><li>Seven West Media will do very well out of the media bargaining code.</li></ul><p>Corporate welfare, crony capitalism, rent seeking; call it what you will.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin in particular - are once again in the news. It's not hard to understand why, with the price of a coin rapidly approaching $50,000 following Elon Musk's announcement that Tesla had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html">purchased $1.5 billion</a> in bitcoin and will start accepting it as payment: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/02/bitcoin-price-feb-2021.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="933" height="524" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/bitcoin-price-feb-2021.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/02/bitcoin-price-feb-2021.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It's not just eccentric billionaires such as Musk that are suddenly giving crypto some long-deserved attention, either. Mastercard <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/">announced last week</a> that it "is bringing crypto onto its network":</p><blockquote>Doing this work will create a lot more possibilities for shoppers and merchants, allowing them to transact in an entirely new form of payment. This change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets, and help sellers build loyalty with existing customers who want this additional option. And customers will be able to save, store and send money in new ways.</blockquote><p>The price of bitcoin has risen by around 760% from the pandemic-driven low in mid-March 2020. Is it a bubble? Most likely, yes. While having certain cryptocurrencies accepted on payment networks such as Mastercard is huge (and should help to reduce costs for certain transactions, such as international transfers), nothing much has changed since March 2020 to justify a 7x increase in price. Decentralised finance (DeFi) has <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/neobanks-solarwind-and-the-us-army/">the potential</a> to disrupt stock exchanges and banking, but it's just potential and that's not why the price of Bitcoin is rising. </p><p>No, Bitcoin has risen 760% because we're in a stimulus-fuelled business cycle. Many of the world's governments and central banks unleashed large demand-focused programmes in 2020-21, driving up asset prices (the NASDAQ is up more than 100% over the same period).</p><p>Bitcoin is an asset that's relatively easy to buy, is liquid, has a finite supply and virtually zero carry costs. So when people are given 'free' cash that is yielding nothing and will gradually depreciate in value, they'll tend to speculate on assets such as Bitcoin. Add the fact that Bitcoin is best thought of as the gold of cryptocurrencies - a digital asset used as a store of wealth - but without the overheads and regulations, and it makes sense that it would rise during a large expansion of broad <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2">money supply</a> and rapid growth in <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTBKCR">bank credit</a>. Ray Dalio did a <a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/ray-dalio-what-i-think-of-bitcoin">good write-up</a> from that perspective last week:</p><blockquote>There aren’t many alternative gold-like assets at this time of rising need for them (because of all the debt and money creations that are underway and will happen in the future). Because of what is going on in the world, besides there being a growing need for money or storehold of wealth assets that are limited in supply, there is also a growing need for assets that can be privately held. Because there aren’t many of these gold-like storehold of wealth assets that can be held in privacy and because the sizes of their markets are relatively small, there exists the possibility that Bitcoin and its competitors can fill that growing need. It seems to me that Bitcoin has succeeded in crossing the line from being a highly speculative idea that could well not be around in short order to probably being around and probably having some value in the future.</blockquote><p>Could Bitcoin rise another 10, 50 or 100% from here? No doubt. But just remember that <em>all </em>asset prices <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/do-you-like-solar-companies/">are elevated at present</a>, not just cryptocurrencies. This run in price is not unique to crypto: if you are worried that the stock market will crash at some point soon, you should be equally worried that Bitcoin will crash. All the signs of overheating are there, with even <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-southkorea-student-inv/south-korean-boy-investor-with-43-gains-is-new-retail-trading-icon-idUSKBN2A90YL">12 year-old children getting into the stock market</a>! I'd love to say Bitcoin has "<a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/stock-market-crash-of-1929">reached what looks like a permanently high plateau</a>", but I think we all know how this is going to end when the monetary and fiscal stimulus dries up.</p><h3 id="shock-horror-australian-authorities-misuse-data">Shock. Horror. Australian authorities misuse data</h3><p>Legislated privacy can be undermined, breached or <a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/security/data-retention-laws-australian-police-given-new-metadata-recommendations/news-story/29b6c3c9f831e70b5d0898758e9acfbf">simply ignored</a>:</p><blockquote>All law enforcement agencies investigated in a recent probe accessed Australians’ metadata without the proper authorisation, the Commonwealth Ombudsman has reported. <br><br>The Ombudsman identified a “critical need” for staff to understand the law after auditing 10 agencies’ compliance with controversial metadata retention laws that require telcos to retain information about communications for at least two years. <br><br>“We identified instances at all inspections in 2018-19 where agencies had accessed telecommunications data without proper authority. As such, the disclosure of the data was unauthorised,” the Ombudsman said in a report tabled in parliament last week.</blockquote><p>Nothing is safe unless it's encrypted. Not even the "laws of Australia" can undermine properly implemented encryption, despite what former Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2018/australias-encryption-gamble/">might think</a>. Remember, governments are notoriously <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-solarwinds-china/exclusive-suspected-chinese-hackers-used-solarwinds-bug-to-spy-on-u-s-payroll-agency-sources-idUSKBN2A22K8">poor at securing data</a>:</p><blockquote>The software flaw exploited by the suspected Chinese group is separate from the one the United States has accused Russian government operatives of using to compromise up to 18,000 SolarWinds customers, including sensitive federal agencies, by hijacking the company’s Orion network monitoring software. <br><br>Security researchers have previously said a second group of hackers was abusing SolarWinds’ software at the same time as the alleged Russian hack, but the suspected connection to China and ensuing U.S. government breach have not been previously reported.</blockquote><h3 id="how-cool-is-starlink">How cool is Starlink</h3><blockquote>Starlink is now delivering initial beta service both domestically and internationally, and will continue expansion to near global coverage of the populated world in 2021. <br><br>During beta, users can expect to see data speeds vary from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s and latency from 20ms to 40ms in most locations over the next several months as we enhance the Starlink system. There will also be brief periods of no connectivity at all. <br><br>As we launch more satellites, install more ground stations and improve our networking software, data speed, latency and uptime will improve dramatically.</blockquote><p>Yes, SpaceX's Starlink has received <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/spacex-starlink-wins-nearly-900-million-in-fcc-subsidies-auction.html">nearly $1 billion</a> in US government subsidies ("to support rural broadband customers"). It was one of 180 companies that received a combined total of $9.2 billion in subsidies. That doesn't make it right but at least SpaceX didn't actively seek out the favour.</p><p>But how cool is it that a private company is rolling out a <em>global</em> broadband network with minimal taxpayer support? The Australian government, you <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/musks-starlink-chinas-tech-crackdown-summers-on-the-stimulus-yglesias-on-s230/">might recall</a>, has so far spent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/13/nbn-blames-pandemic-for-67bn-funding-blowout-as-execs-rake-in-bonuses">more than $A57.7 billion</a> on a national broadband upgrade (the 'NBN') that is today valued below $A10 billion. Starlink's beta product is slightly more expensive than the equivalent NBN plan and has a relatively high setup fee, but it's low latency (20-40ms versus the ~60-80ms I get when pinging Bing, which may <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/whats-a-google/">soon replace</a> Google in Australia) and costs nothing in additional taxes.</p><p>There are of course regulatory and national security questions that still need to be answered. For instance, can the US government (or any other government) order Starlink to cut off an entire city or country? What metadata are being collected, and where will it be stored? I'd prefer it if Starlink was designed to be more decentralised, with anyone allowed to upload a 'node' (satellite), much like they can with the internet or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">Fediverse</a>. But it's promising nonetheless.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of California’s techies have finally had enough, opting for the sunshine of Florida over the sunshine of the West Coast. Other than the sunk costs and network effects (e.g. there are lots of coders already in San Francisco), it actually makes a lot of sense, for a few reasons.</p><p>On the one hand, you have San Francisco. California has the highest state income tax in the United States (<a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/fun-facts/states-with-the-highest-and-lowest-taxes/L6HPAVqSF">13.3%</a>, which is now actually important due to the 2017-18 <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/04/the-salt-tax-deduction-is-a-handout-to-the-rich-it-should-be-eliminated-not-expanded/">cap on federal income tax deductions</a> for taxes paid to state and local governments). The <a href="https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/most-expensive-cities-in-the-us">most expensive property prices</a> in the United States. Politicians who are <a href="https://twitter.com/lorenasgonzalez/status/1259287879177531392">openly antagonistic</a> toward well-to-do tech workers. The smoke from the fires that burn every year due to the government's <a href="https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2020/09/smoke-and-nukes.html">poor management</a> of its forests.</p><p>Then on the other hand there’s Miami, Florida. Sure, it gets ravaged by hurricanes every year and its summers are brutally hot, but it has no state income tax and Miami's Mayor, Francis Suarez, <a href="https://twitter.com/francissuarez/status/1335037068108554241">actually <em>wants</em></a> tech workers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/join-us-in-miami-love-masters-of-the-universe.html">relocate to his city</a>:</p><blockquote>“It was a lightning-in-the-bottle moment,” said Mr. Suarez, 43, who became mayor in 2017. “For them to hear an elected official saying, ‘Hey, we want you, hey, we appreciate you’ — I didn’t realize what a sensitive moment it was in terms of how people felt they were being treated by the governments where they lived.”</blockquote><p>Suarez will meet anyone who asks and is big on frontier tech such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies, offering to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/miami-mayor-says-city-employees-should-be-able-to-take-their-salaries-in-bitcoin">pay his staff in bitcoin</a>. His government even hosts Satoshi’s White Paper on a <a href="https://www.miamigov.com/Government/City-Officials/Mayor-Francis-Suarez/Bitcoin-White-Paper">government website</a>. What’s not to like?</p><p>But Miami is not alone in seeking to attract techiepreneurs. Nevada is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-legislation-local-governments-nevada-economy-2fa79128a7bf41073c1e9102e8a0e5f0">investigating</a> allowing tech companies to create their own local government bodies - so-called 'Innovation Zones' - so that they may avoid being economically 'captured' by the next city. Then there's Austin, Texas, which also has no state income tax and is known as being a '<a href="https://observer.com/2020/12/elon-musk-tech-leaving-silicon-valley-for-texas-billionaires/">liberal hub</a>' in red Texas. According to Elon Musk:</p><blockquote>If a team has been winning for too long they do tend to get a little complacent, a little entitled and then they don’t win the championship anymore. California’s been winning for a long time. And I think they’re taking them [tech workers] for granted a little bit.</blockquote><p>California is suffering a brain drain and its leaders seem content to let the state burn so long as they <a href="https://twitter.com/gameofthrones/status/328254880248627201?lang=en">may rule over the ashes</a>.</p><h3 id="robinhood-is-the-facebook-of-finance">Robinhood is the Facebook of finance</h3><p>Well, sort of. Robinhood only offers commission-free trading because you’re the product, not the customer. It makes money from what’s called payment for order flow (PFOF), where instead of trading commissions, it sells its customers’ buy and sell orders directly to market-making firms, such as Citadel, Virtu, or Two Sigma. It shops those sell orders around for the widest spread possible between the national best bid and offer of the security at the time of execution, maximising the revenue it earns.</p><p>PFOF is banned in the UK and Canada as it supposedly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-payment-for-order-flow-gamestop-regulation-revenue-2021-2">harms consumers</a>:</p><blockquote>In 2016, the CFA Institute, a not-for-profit organization that handles the exam for chartered financial analysts, published a report examining the effects of PFOF in the UK, which banned the practice in 2012. The report found that from 2010 to 2014, the percentage of retail-size trades that were executed at the best-quoted price jumped from 65% to 90%.</blockquote><p>However, the price received when using PFOF is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow">still better than the 'national best bid and offer' on the stock exchange</a>! In other words, the "widest spread possible between the national best bid and offer of the security at the time of execution" is still a <em>price improvement</em>. Robinhood just takes a larger cut of that improvement than do companies that charge a trading commission up front.</p><p>If PFOF is banned, the broker takes a smaller cut of the price improvement (using the example above, this improves the percentage of trades executed at the best-quoted price by 25 percentage points) but has to charge a larger commission. That's clearly something consumers don't want, as the practice has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow">reshaped the trading landscape in the US</a> (for the better):</p><blockquote>A few years back, Robinhood Markets Inc. had a crucial insight: Instead of charging a $5 commission and passing along 80% of the wholesaler’s discount to customers in the form of price improvement, it could charge no commission and pass along 20%, keeping the other 80% for itself. <br>... <br>And their original insight caused a lasting change to the retail brokerage business. Free trades really were a lot more appealing than $5 trades. This model attracted customers to Robinhood, which quickly became the hot brokerage for the young trading-on-their-phones crowd. It pressured other retail brokerages to do away with commissions too, and eventually most did; now the norm, if you want to trade stock, is that you can do it for free. Also, intuitively, it is good for volume: If it costs you $5 to trade stock, you will feel some friction; you won’t want to sit around trading stocks frantically all day, because those $5 charges add up. If it costs you $0 to trade stock, there is no friction, and if you don’t have a lot else going on—say during a pandemic-induced lockdown—you really might sit around all day trading stocks. Since your broker gets some PFOF on every order, this is good for your broker: Doing 100 free trades, each with a bit of PFOF, is probably better for the broker than doing one $5 trade.</blockquote><p>Now if there were ever a practice that should be banned it’s not putting sunset review clauses into regulations. As I alluded to in last week’s update [<a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/gamestop-and-the-battle-of-david-vs-goliath/">Issue 98</a>], it turns out a lot of the drama surrounding the Robinhood trading halt <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-robinhood-ceo-idUSKBN2A22VG">was preventable</a>:</p><blockquote>It’s time to consider real-time settlement in U.S. equities trading, Robinhood Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev said, after the online brokerage suffered immense financial strain from a retail trading frenzy that rocked Wall Street last week. <br><br>“There is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time. Doing so would greatly mitigate the risk that such processing poses,” Tenev, who is also a co-founder of Robinhood, said in a blog post. The securities industry currently follows a two-day settlement system.</blockquote><p>Regulation is rigid and does not adapt well to advances in technology or consumer preferences. Forcing politicians to at least review and sign off on existing regulations every few years would be a good start.</p><h3 id="microsoft-begs-to-be-taxed">Microsoft begs to be taxed</h3><p>Shock. Horror. <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/willing-to-live-by-these-rules-microsoft-commits-to-media-code-20210203-p56z1g">Microsoft supports Australia’s news media bargaining code</a>:</p><blockquote>Microsoft president Brad Smith said he wants the company to grow in Australia to a point where there is "significant" revenue to share with publishers. <br><br>"We are more than willing to share. Part of what this means is that we’re very comfortable growing Bing in Australia with a lower profit margin than what Google is extracting today. We need to make sure we can grow to achieve that. We can't share money we're not making," he said. <br><br>"But we're comfortable with a different kind of business model for search. We're comfortable with a business model that will better serve the news media and Australia as a whole."</blockquote><p>Duh. Microsoft stands to profit handsomely if Google were to leave the market. Let's do some basic arithmetic:</p><p>Microsoft's search engine, Bing, has a 3.8% market share in Australia, versus Google search's 94.4% share. If Google disappeared - remember, it's <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/whats-a-google/">threatening to leave the Australian market</a> if this legislation passes in its current form - and Microsoft took just half of that (i.e. ended up with around 50% total market share), that’s a 1,200% increase.</p><p>That means the Australian government could extract almost all of Microsoft's Bing revenue in Australia - around 92%, to be precise - and Microsoft would still be better off. As awful as the media bargaining code is, it's not bad enough to wipe out 92% of search revenue in this country.</p><p>No wonder Microsoft is willing to "share". Just kneecap our competition first, please.</p><h3 id="speaking-of-taxes-">Speaking of taxes...</h3><p>...The United States is going to need more if Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package passes (who are we kidding, the Fed will just monetise it). </p><p>But seriously, the chance of higher future taxes is actually just a sideshow. The real problem of the package is that it'll stimulate demand into what has mostly been a supply shock, as governments have mistakenly been doing throughout the pandemic:</p><blockquote>The 1.9 trillion program could overheat the economy so badly as to be counterproductive.  Protection can be achieved with less. <br><br>If this increase in demand could be accommodated, it would lead to a level of output at 14% above potential. It would take the unemployment rate very close to zero. <br><br>This would not be overheating; it would be starting a fire.</blockquote><p>The above quote is from <a href="https://twitter.com/ojblanchard1/status/1358122330329927680">Olivier Blanchard</a>, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. He's notoriously dovish (i.e., not fiscally conservative), anti-austerity, and was a big supporter of large global fiscal and monetary stimulus following the Global Financial Crisis. When even Blanchard can see that spending of this magnitude is a bad idea, it's probably a bad idea.</p><p>Provided no monetary offsets, we might get some strong price inflation sooner than markets expect (and years before central bank forecasts).</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now everyone should be familiar with the GameStop saga but if you're not, below is a recap. Feel free to skim down to the "The Outlook" if you're already up to speed.</p><h3 id="the-recap">The Recap</h3><p>On Reddit - a social news aggregation and discussion website - there exists a 'subreddit' called <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">wallstreetbets</a></em>, which is essentially an echo chamber for retail investors looking to pile into relatively cheap, high risk stocks with the aim of turning a quick, large profit. It's basically the internet's home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump">pump and dumps</a> where the more people they can convince to buy a stock, the higher the price goes, and the more money (some) people stand to make.</p><p>The users in <em>wallstreetbets</em> tend to be young, favouring the smartphone trading app Robinhood as it's easy to set up and is commission-free. The subreddit's mascot is a child wearing a suit and users regularly boast about being retarded or autistic... you get the idea.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/wallstbets-logo-med.png" class="kg-image" alt="/r/wallstreetbets logo" loading="lazy" width="640" height="396" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/wallstbets-logo-med.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/wallstbets-logo-med.png 640w"></figure><p>About a week ago users on <em>wallstreetbets</em> decided to take aim at GameStop, a floundering company (think the Blockbuster of video games) that, it turned out, had been heavily shorted by some very large and well connected hedge funds. One of those funds was Melvin Capital, which lost billions of dollars in days as the GameStop share price surged ('squeezing' their shorts). That led to the firm needing a multi-billion dollar bailout from its owners, Point72 and Citadel, allowing Melvin to reportedly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html">close out</a> its short positions at a huge loss.</p><p>But that didn't stop the members of <em>wallstreetbets.</em> They doubled down, buying not just GameStop but also other companies that had been heavily shorted such as AMC Theatres, Blockbuster and more recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/silver-market-jitters-are-on-display-after-reddit-frenzy">silver</a>, effectively squeezing any remaining shorts and wiping out <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/avalon-penrose-gamestop-explainer-video-viral-comedy-1565048">at least $23.6 billion</a> from various hedge funds in the process. Global markets lost a lot of value on Thursday, some of which may have been due to hedge funds - worried about <em>wallstreetbets</em> targeting their trades - closing out long positions to cover their shorts.</p><p>It's essentially a modern day David and Goliath story, with thousands of David's taking on some of the biggest Goliath's on Wall Street. What's not to like?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/gamestop-trading.png" class="kg-image" alt="GameStop's volume has risen enormously" loading="lazy" width="714" height="481" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gamestop-trading.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/gamestop-trading.png 714w"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-mania-reveals-power-shift-on-wall-streetand-the-pros-are-reeling-11611774663">WSJ</a></figcaption></figure><p>But as one might expect, those Goliath's are well connected. As mentioned earlier, a company called Citadel is a part owner of Melvin Capital, the hedge fund that levered heavily into GameStock short positions.</p><p>Citadel is also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/29/robinhood-citadel-gamestop-reddit/">one of the biggest sources of revenue</a> for the Robinhood app, which charges large investment firms such as Citadel - 'market makers' - fees to access real-time information about the stocks its users are buying and selling.</p><p>So it should come as no surprise that with billions being wiped out every day, the pressure to do something mounted. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a1b24e6-0433-462a-a860-c2504ea565e4">Sure enough</a>, Robinhood soon restricted <em>buying</em> shares in GameStop and a few other companies that had also been pumped by <em>wallstreetbets</em>.</p><p>You heard that correctly: selling on Robinhood was still allowed, people just couldn't buy. It was a move that temporarily thwarted <em>wallstreetbets</em>, with only the big boys able to trade freely given they don't rely on middlemen brokerage apps like Robinhood to make their trades. Robinhood, if you didn't gather from its name, was an app supposedly designed to take from the rich and give to the poor, or "<a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/712708069369782272">let the people trade</a>".</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/robinhood-twitter.png" class="kg-image" alt="Robinhood &quot;let the people trade&quot;" loading="lazy" width="588" height="228"></figure><p>Robinhood is now subject to at least one class-action lawsuit accusing it of market manipulation, along with calls from politicians to investigate the company. In what is a rare sight these days in Washington, there was even <a href="https://notthebee.com/article/how-insane-is-what-robinhood-did-to-gamestop-investors-don-jr-aoc-ted-cruz-rashida-tlaib-and-ben-shapiro-are-all-in-agreement-on-it">bipartisan support</a>!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/wallstreetbets-pollies.png" class="kg-image" alt="Bipartisan support!" loading="lazy" width="600" height="662" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/wallstreetbets-pollies.png 600w"></figure><p>However, there was also a financial reason for Robinhood restricting buying other than its cosy relationship with Citadel. Robinhood, as mentioned earlier, charges zero commission on retail trades. But according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/heres-why-robinhood-restricting-users-173049721.html">Webull CEO Anthony Denier</a>, when you make a trade, brokerage firms: </p><blockquote>...have to fund that trade with the clearing central house called DTC for two whole days. And because of the volatility of stocks, DTC has made the cost of the collateral of the two-day holding period extremely expensive. <br><br>And we just can't afford-- well, we're not a clearing firm, but our clearing firm simply cannot afford the cost to settle those trades. We cannot use customer funds to front that cost due to regulation. So the brokerages or the clearing firms have to go into their own pockets to do it. And they simply can't afford the cost of that trade clearance. That is the reason why these stocks are coming off. It has nothing to do with the decision or some sort of closed room cigar-- smoke-filled cigar room of Wall Street firms getting together to the dismay of the retail trader. This has to do with settlement mechanics of the market.</blockquote><p>I'm not sure why clearing firms have to hold collateral for two entire days. It sounds like a throwback from the old days where everything was done with paper and funds took days to clear. Outdated regulation perhaps? Whatever the reason, the requirement exists and the GameStop trade was getting very costly for Robinhood, which had to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a1b24e6-0433-462a-a860-c2504ea565e4">raise $1 billion</a> due to all of the capital it had tied up at clearing houses.</p><p>But back to the story.</p><p>At the time of writing, <em>wallstreetbets</em> is still holding strong. GameStop shares closed at $325 on Friday, close to the all-time high of $347.5. But at the end of the day this is a plain old pump and dump, requiring a continual stream of 'greater fools' to keep the price elevated - GameStop is a firm teetering on the edge of bankruptcy - and the share price will, eventually, come back down to earth.</p><h3 id="the-outlook">The Outlook</h3><p>As with any negative-sum game, there will be winners and there will be losers. I have no problem with <em>wallstreetbets </em>users engaging in this kind of activity. If you're a 20 year old with idle hands (e.g. furloughed due to COVID-19 restrictions) and plenty of cash in the bank thanks to multiple rounds of government handouts, but nothing to spend it on - millennials look for <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/millennials-look-for-experiences-over-possessions/">experiences over possessions</a>, remember - why wouldn't you have a punt on GameStop, especially if you could take a hedge fund down a peg or two in the process? It sure beats the casino!</p><p>I also have no problem with hedge funds shorting stocks in companies such as GameStop. It's an effective way to express a negative opinion about a company and helps the market price discovery process. However, shorts can be squeezed and that's <em>perfectly fine</em>.</p><p>The worst case scenario from here - and probably the most likely (that's the cynic in me) - would be if regulators eventually decide to further restrict short selling <strong>and</strong> put limits on retail traders' ability to buy, all in the name of 'protecting' people from themselves.</p><p>Apparently the the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-white-house-idUSKBN29W2I1">Treasury Department</a> is monitoring the situation. Now on what side of this might Treasury fall, you ask? Just follow the money. Treasury is now headed by none other than former Federal Reserve Chairperson Janet Yellen, herself the recipient of... wait for it... $337,500 in October 2020, $292,500 in October 2019, and $180,000 in December 2019 from, you guessed it: Citadel!</p><p>Why did Citadel pay Yellen close to a million dollars over the course of a year? For <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/28/wh-shouldnt-be-a-surprise-yellen-paid-to-speak-to-wall-street/">three speeches</a>, where she offered them "her perspective and advice".</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Maybe Yellen will prove me wrong. I just can't get past the fact that a million dollars in a single year for very little work buys a lot of influence, so my default position is that Treasury will end up supporting some kind of regulation that helps companies such as Citadel, or at least does them no harm. Sorry, <em>wallstreetbets</em>.</p><p>But crony capitalist revolving-door moral hazard issues aside, what this whole saga really highlights is how incredibly frothy markets are at the moment (see <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/do-you-like-solar-companies/">Issue 96</a>). Everyone from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-mania-reveals-power-shift-on-wall-streetand-the-pros-are-reeling-11611774663">'recent law school students' to 'Atlanta residents'</a> have seemingly become day traders, and the prevailing wisdom among that group is that "fundamentals do not apply to retail traders. It’s all about sentiment. The only reason why Tesla is worth what it is is because people believe in that company".</p><p>The pandemic lit the financial fire, with governments and central banks turning it into a roaring inferno by <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/it-has-been-a-long-five-months/">mistakenly stimulating demand</a> during what has been mostly a supply side shock. This will end badly for many.</p><h3 id="in-other-news-google-doesn-t-make-money-from-news">In other news, Google doesn't make money from... news</h3><p>I've been writing for a while about the Australian government's foolish attempt to subsidise legacy media companies by stealth taxing Big Tech (see <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/whats-a-google/">Issue 97</a>). It <a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=COMMITTEES;id=committees%2Fcommsen%2F02941cc9-876a-4688-8b9f-e037a6452c8e%2F0001;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Fcommsen%2F02941cc9-876a-4688-8b9f-e037a6452c8e%2F0000%22">turns out</a> Google doesn’t even make money from news media:</p><blockquote>It's also important for me to point out that news-seeking queries do not generate revenue for Google. It's very unlikely that an advertiser would like to appear next to news content on search, as opposed to a query with high commercial intent. News queries are about 1.25 per cent of the queries that we see on our search engine. So to the extent that this code is requiring us to pay for links and snippets in search to a small group of people who participate in our search results, where it's always been the publisher's choice to appear in those results and they are the beneficiaries of valuable traffic, that is the model of search. The advertising business is very targeted.</blockquote><p>Richard Holden, Professor of economics at UNSW, had a <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/media-code-is-a-stalinist-show-trial-20210127-p56x31">good article</a> on the subject in the AFR last week:</p><blockquote>[Google leaving Australia] is neither an idle threat, nor an unreasonable one. The media bargaining code is hopelessly flawed. It misunderstands the cause of the decline in media revenues, seeks to extract money from unrelated activities of technology companies like Google and Facebook, has requirements that threaten the core business of those companies, and has a bargaining system that could most politely be described as "rigged". It is the public policy equivalent of Stalinist show trial.</blockquote><p>I no longer expect the media code to get through Parliament. It's just too contrived and gets the facts completely backward. Even politicians - or at the very least their advisors - should eventually realise that this legislation is rotten to the core.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy early Australia Day (26 Jan for non-Australian readers), a country where the verb 'Google' may <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/google-threatens-to-remove-search-in-australia-as-spat-escalates">soon become obsolete</a>:</p><blockquote>A proposed law, intended to compensate publishers for the value their stories generate for the company, is “unworkable,” Mel Silva, managing director for Australia and New Zealand, told a parliamentary hearing Friday. She specifically opposed the requirement that Google pay media companies for displaying snippets of articles in search results. <br><br>The threat is Google’s most potent yet as the digital giant tries to stem a flow of regulatory action worldwide, but such a radical step would hand an entire developed market to rivals. At least 94% of online searches in Australia go through the Alphabet Inc. unit, according to the local competition regulator. <br>...<br>“If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,” Silva told a panel of senators. She described the law as an “untenable financial and operational precedent.”<br>...<br>Facebook Inc., the only other company targeted by the legislation, also opposes the law. The social media platform reiterated at Friday’s hearing it’s considering blocking Australians from sharing news on Facebook if the law is pushed through.</blockquote><p>These are legitimate threats. The Australian market is somewhere between the size of Florida and Texas, but the risks to Google and Facebook's respective business models run far deeper than Australia. If the tech giants don't follow through with their threats to leave or block Australians from sharing news - and the Australian government doesn't back down - then every other anti-tech banana republic will soon come calling for a pound of flesh as well.</p><p>The legislation is the result of rent seeking, plain and simple. Instead of subsidising Australia's fading legacy media companies directly (on balance sheet) and defending that decision to the electorate, the Australian government has opted to take the coward's way out, effectively taxing a couple of foreign companies to prop up some local dinosaurs. Unfortunately for Australians - who may soon be forced to use less effective search engines and only share news published in foreign countries - the Australian government does not seem to be retreating:</p><blockquote>“We don’t respond to threats,” Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday. “Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That’s done in our parliament. It’s done by our government. And that’s how things work here in Australia.”</blockquote><p>Yes, that is how things work here in Australia. Just as former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2018/australias-encryption-gamble/">claimed that</a> "the laws of mathematics are very commendable but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia", the Australian government will not listen to reason and is intent on legislating its people into the Stone Age.</p><p>Happy Australia Day. Treat yourself to <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/the-best-privacy-tools-of-2020/">a good VPN</a>, you may actually need one soon.</p><h3 id="ignore-the-biden-hype">Ignore the Biden hype</h3><p>The media will give President Joe Biden a free pass over the next few months for no other reason than <em>he's not Donald Trump</em>, but don't expect Biden to suddenly buck the trend of poor governance. He is, after all, a 45-year career politician who knows nothing else but how to wheel and deal in the so-called 'swamp'.</p><p>Two days into his Presidency and Biden has already disappointed in terms of the pandemic. Remember this tweet?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/joe-biden-covid-plan.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="750" height="806" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/joe-biden-covid-plan.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/joe-biden-covid-plan.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Biden's big pandemic plan was to administer 100 million doses of a vaccine in his first 100 days in office. It sounded impressive but it really wasn't: the day after Biden was inaugurated, the United States administered 1.02 million doses, up from 818,000 the day prior. The day after that, it administered another 1.56 million doses. In other words, given the existing trend, 100 million vaccinations should have been the <em>minimum</em> after 100 days in office, not the plan.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/us-vaccinations-22jan.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="911" height="661" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/us-vaccinations-22jan.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/us-vaccinations-22jan.png 911w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Biden seems content with his modest plan, more recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/biden-says-nothing-can-change-the-trajectory-of-covid-pandemic-over-the-next-several-months.html">proclaiming</a> that:</p><blockquote>There's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months.</blockquote><p>But there's plenty he could do to change the trajectory of the pandemic, the most effective of which would be to <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/01/we-will-get-to-herd-immunity-in-2021-one-way-or-another.html">speed up the vaccination rollout</a>. But nope, now that he's President, there's nothing 'we' can do. When quizzed by the media about his soft plan, Biden <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/22/politics/fact-check-biden-100-million-doses-vaccine-goal-media/index.html">counterattacked</a>:</p><blockquote>When I announced it, you all said it's not possible. Come on, give me a break, man. It's a good start -- 100 million.</blockquote><p>A blatant lie on his first day, which <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/22/politics/fact-check-biden-100-million-doses-vaccine-goal-media/index.html">even CNN</a> could see through:</p><blockquote>Biden's claim is false; it's not true that there was an initial media consensus that the 100 million goal was impossible. Some of the early news coverage of the goal did not even question whether it was plausible. Some experts featured in the early coverage, including CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, said the goal was achievable. And while some journalists and experts were more skeptical, cautioning that the goal was ambitious, they did not go so far as to say it was impossible.</blockquote><p>It's not the only lie the Biden administration has told in its first couple of days, either. Less than a day after signing an executive order mandating that masks be worn on all federal property, Biden was spotted without a mask on said federal property with family members, also without masks. True it was only for a <a href="https://7news.com.au/politics/us-election/truth-behind-picture-of-biden-without-mask-just-hours-after-he-made-it-mandatory-c-2008171">brief period of time</a>, but Biden has in the past made a big deal about the "power of our example", which this goes against. Worse, his White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki responded in a manner that would not have been out of place in the previous <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/22/jen-psaki-brushes-off-criticism-of-maskless-bidens/">administration</a>:</p><blockquote>I think the power of his example is also the message he sends by signing 25 executive orders, including almost half of them related to COVID, the requirements that we’re all under every single day here to ensure that we’re sending that message to the public. Yesterday was a historic moment in our history. He was inaugurated as president of the United States. He was surrounded by his family. We take a number of precautions, but I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time.</blockquote><p>Don't get your hopes up that the Biden administration will be any different to those that came before. More predictable, sure. But it will largely be the same old, same old, where there are rules for thee but not for me and friends of the administration will make out like bandits.</p><p>Always <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-23/-dark-money-helped-pave-joe-biden-s-path-to-the-white-house">follow the money</a>!</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Markets are hot right now. <strong>Very hot</strong>. All the usual warning signs are flashing red, from soaring asset prices to unsolicited stock advice<a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/market-newbies-discover-penny-stocks-and-1-trillion-shares-get-traded-20210115-p56u98.html"> from cleaning ladies</a>:</p><blockquote>When you see all this stuff coming out and all these people talking about penny stocks and pushing them higher, it's got to make you wonder, where is the top? Is it too frothy? Is there too much exuberance out there?" said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence's Zephyr. "That's my concern -- the fear of missing out is driving stock prices." <br>...<br>Cromwell Coulson, the president of OTC Markets, says there's a simple explanation for all the buying. "It's clearly a bull market," he said. "I would be very careful. We're definitely in a market where my cleaning lady is asking me 'Do I like solar companies?' Because she bought a solar company that's a NASDAQ stock through Robinhood. And it's tripled."</blockquote><p>The cleaning lady analogy draws from an old story about Joe Kennedy (JFK's father), <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Great_Depression">who</a>:</p><blockquote>...decided to stop to have his shoes shined before he started his day's work at the office. When the boy finished, he offered Kennedy a stock tip: "Buy Hindenburg." Kennedy soon sold off his stocks, thinking: "You know it's time to sell when shoeshine boys give you stock tips. This bull market is over."</blockquote><p>A similar quote has been attributed to <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/04/15/211503/index.htm">Bernard Baruch</a>, who made a fortune in the 1920s US bull market but sold well prior to the crash in 1929:</p><blockquote>Taxi drivers told you what to buy. The shoeshine boy could give you a summary of the day's financial news as he worked with rag and polish. An old beggar who regularly patrolled the street in front of my office now gave me tips and, I suppose, spent the money I and others gave him in the market.

While the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/the-unemployment-rate-is-above-20percent-for-the-lowest-paid-workers-feds-brainard-says.html">bottom quartile is struggling</a>, lots of people have actually done quite well working from home, accumulating savings while their respective governments <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/those-2-000-checks-wont-boost-the-economy-11610665993">thrust even more cash at them</a>:</p><blockquote>“The damage from COVID-19 is concentrated among already challenged groups,” Brainard said in a speech Wednesday. “The K-shaped recovery remains highly uneven, with certain sectors and groups experiencing substantial hardship.” <br><br>At a time when the national unemployment rate has come down from the pandemic peak of 14.7% to the current 6.7%, Fed economists estimate the jobless rate for the lowest quartile of earners is “likely above 20%,” Brainard said. </blockquote><p>Much of the global stimulus has flowed not to businesses and individuals who have suffered legitimate hardship but into assets, which are now easier than ever to speculate on thanks to micro-investing app such as Robinhood. Just look at what happened to an obscure stock called Signal Advance Inc. when everyone's favourite salesman, Elon Musk, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153">tweeted</a> "Use Signal":</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/signal-advance-inc.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="635" height="401" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/signal-advance-inc.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/signal-advance-inc.png 635w"></figure><p>Signal Advance is, of course, completely unrelated to Signal Messenger, which I've been recommending for years and is what Musk was tweeting about following the <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/its-time-to-uninstall-whatsapp/">WhatsApp debacle</a>. But a sufficient cohort of people are so cashed up and enthused they don't care: just buy, buy buy!</p><p>I'm not going to pretend I know how long this euphoria will continue. But price surges and corrections will probably hit different markets at different times, given the interconnectedness of the global financial system.</p><p>Take China, which last year embarked on a massive credit-fuelled, infrastructure-led stimulus programme. Its credit growth <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-social-financing/china-outstanding-total-social-financing-up-133-y-y-at-end-dec-idUSB9N2I602F">eased slightly in December</a>, but given how centrally directed much of China's economy still is, the outlook will depend heavily on the policy stance adopted in its 'Two Sessions' in early March. Xi Jinping will have learnt from the 2014-15 taper and will also want to maintain an appearance of strength on the world stage with a new US President, so I expect Chinese-driven demand to slow but remain relatively buoyant at least until the second half of 2021.</p><p>In the US and other more market-oriented economies, the outlook depends on vaccine efficacy and rollout (long lasting social distancing and on-again, off-again lockdowns will keep activity subdued), how long central banks decide to keep their feet firmly pressed on the liquidity pedal and how much debt governments are willing to accrue to continuously hand out cash to many who simply don't need it.</p><p>But I find it hard to believe earnings will ever live up to the current lofty expectations for many companies, so when the hot money eventually dries up, a decent reality check is in order.

Network effects aren’t enough to fend off potential competition unless the incumbent continuously improves and innovates.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you use WhatsApp it's probably because it works well, is easy to use and best of all it's end-to-end encrypted (WhatsApp is encrypted with the Signal protocol - but Facebook holds the encryption keys). But you might want to consider changing.</p><p>Facebook has <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-data-chief-tells-ministries-whatsapp-is-a-no-go/a-53474413">in the past</a> denied that it uses the data captured by WhatsApp. However, it recently announced that on 8 February that will all change, with WhatsApp <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/">updating its privacy policy</a> to allow Facebook to collect:</p><ul><li>user phone numbers;</li><li>anything stored in your phone's address book;</li><li>profile names and pictures;</li><li>status messages, including when a user was last online;</li><li>diagnostic data collected from app logs; and</li><li>share that data with other Facebook companies.</li></ul><p>The weaknesses in WhatsApp's implementation of the Signal protocol mean that Facebook will now have enough information to build comprehensive profiles of anyone who uses it, even if they're not on Facebook. That's because other than the list above, WhatsApp already captures unencrypted metadata such as <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/whatsapp-security-flaw-over-60000-groups-still-accessible-online/a-52543414">group names and descriptions</a>, when you add a new member or remove an existing one, all images, who talks to whom, how frequently and at what times.</p><p>In addition, I've <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/dont-backup-your-conversations/">written before</a> about WhatsApp's automatic backup feature, which uploads all of your content to its servers <em>without</em> client-side encryption, meaning anything backed up is fully available to Facebook (why do you think they prompt you to enable it every month?).</p><p>The good news is that there's an alternative: <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>. It's also encrypted with the Signal protocol, is open source (so you can be sure there are no backdoors) and has all of the functionality of WhatsApp. Here's a look at the two <a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/internet/whatsapp-policy-update-gives-facebook-data/news-story/c7558c905d4c75daa341d022adb0ca70">side-by-side</a>, using Apple's privacy report, with Signal up first:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/signal-privacy-apple.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="649" height="239" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/signal-privacy-apple.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/signal-privacy-apple.png 649w"></figure><p>Now here's WhatsApp:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/whatsapp-privacy-apple.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="650" height="395" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/whatsapp-privacy-apple.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/whatsapp-privacy-apple.png 650w"></figure><p>Please don't give Facebook any more information: it's time to uninstall WhatsApp! If you have any friends that refuse to switch, forward them this email or <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2021/its-time-to-uninstall-whatsapp">send them a link</a> to it on the website.</p><h3 id="platform-or-publisher-take-3">Platform or Publisher, take 3</h3><p>Are the likes of Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube platforms or publishers? I've asked the question twice before (<a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/platform-or-publisher/">2019</a>, <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/platform-or-publisher-redux/">2020</a>), concluding that while "there is no debate that social media began as a platform. [But] by moving in a direction so far beyond the content moderation threshold dictated by social norms they have laid the groundwork to one day be forced to surrender their platform status".</p><p>Twitter and Facebook have increasingly been moderating the content of their users, culminating in Twitter's <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">permanent suspension</a> of Donald Trump's account last week. It's important to clarify that Twitter is free to ban - sorry, 'permanently suspend' - whomever it wants. Twitter owns Twitter and no one has a 'right' to use it; this is <strong>not</strong> a free speech issue. But that hasn't stopped lawmakers such as <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1347713461246169089">Lindsey Graham</a> misreading the situation and doubling down against Donald Trump's pet peeve, Section 230:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/lindsey-twitter-2021.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="595" height="469"></figure><p>To be clear, removing Section 230 - which protects social media <em>platforms</em> from the content their users post - will not do what Lindsey Graham thinks it will do. Had Section 230 not existed during the Trump Presidency, Twitter would have been liable for his tweets and he would have been banned many years ago (or Twitter would have been sued into oblivion). In fact, removing Section 230 will result in <strong>more</strong> Republicans being banned from Twitter, not less. </p><p>I do worry that Twitter's actions and its gradual shift towards being a publisher will eventually bite it in the backside. It's on a slippery slope of content moderation that will be hard to stop. Facebook and even Apple and Google are also on the slope, with the latter two <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55598887">last week suspending</a> 'free speech' social media <em>platform</em> Parler from their respective app stores due to a failure to remove "egregious content"... in other words, by being <em>too much</em> like a platform and not enough of a publisher? To add insult to injury Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence">withdrew its web hosting service</a>, knocking the entire platform offline.</p><p>I'm not sure how this is going to play out. Where do the creators of "egregious content", such as Donald Trump, vent their frustrations? Left-leaning platforms such as Twitter will ban them, and Google and Apple are gatekeeping Wild West alternatives such as Parler.</p><p>Could this be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">Fediverse's</a> moment to shine? How about a blockchain-based social media platform? What about a revival of blogs or newsletter platforms such as Substack (is Donald Trump capable of writing more than 280 characters at a time)? There's now enough latent demand out there to support <em>something</em> outside the status quo, I just don't know what form it will take.</p><h3 id="meet-the-world-s-new-richest-man">Meet the world's new richest man</h3><p>Elon Musk is now wealthier than Jeff Bezos. On paper, anyway. The story of Tesla has been nothing short of remarkable. Fuelled by record low interest rates, government cash handouts and other forms of demand stimulus, lockdowns limiting people's ability to spend on consumption, and micro trading apps such as Robinhood, Tesla stock has found itself as the pre-eminent speculative asset of choice:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/tesla-share-price-jan-2021.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="658" height="519" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/tesla-share-price-jan-2021.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/tesla-share-price-jan-2021.png 658w"></figure><p>It now has a price/earnings ratio approaching 2,000 (well above the S&amp;P 500's historical average of around 15), meaning people are betting not just on future growth but <em>gargantuan</em> future growth.</p><p>I just cannot see a world in which that is possible (Godzilla wiping out Toyota?). Enjoy it while it lasts, Elon!</p><h3 id="singapore-misuses-covid-19-tracing-data">Singapore misuses COVID-19 tracing data</h3><p>Most governments around the world 'guaranteed' that COVID-19 tracing app data would not be misused. Guess what? <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55541001">It's being misused</a>:</p><blockquote>To encourage people to enrol, Singaporean authorities promised the data would never be used for any other purpose, saying "the data will never be accessed, unless the user tests positive for Covid-19 and is contacted by the contact tracing team". <br><br>But Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan told parliament on Monday that it can in fact also be used "for the purpose of criminal investigation".</blockquote><p>There was just no way that politically influential groups such as the police would be able to resist the honey pot that is coronavirus tracing app location data. I expect this to start happening in many other countries (if it hasn’t already).</p><p>Politically legislated protections and guarantees can and will be undermined. Only install fully transparent, ideally open source contact tracing apps.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In total, SpaceX plans to fly as many as 42,000 Starlink satellites into orbit. The goal is to provide high-speed internet to nearly any location on Earth, and generate $US30 billion to $US50 billion in annual revenue.</blockquote><p>Compare that to the NBN, where 70% of homes and businesses are on a maximum of <a href="https://www.nbnco.com.au/corporate-information/about-nbn-co/updates/dashboard-november-2020">just 50 megabits per second</a>. Australia still ranks well behind most of its OECD peers in terms of speed and take-up (but it performs quite well in mobile broadband, a sector in which the government has largely avoided 'investing').</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/oecd-broadband-subs-1.png" width="998" height="662" loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/oecd-broadband-subs-1.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/oecd-broadband-subs-1.png 998w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/oecd-mobile-subs.png" width="998" height="662" loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/oecd-mobile-subs.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/oecd-mobile-subs.png 998w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/oecd-broadband-speed.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="910" height="661" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/oecd-broadband-speed.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2021/01/oecd-broadband-speed.png 910w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The only way the NBN becomes remotely viable from here is if the government grants it a monopoly over not just fixed line services but also wireless and satellite broadband.

In its 'nightmare' scenario, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-27/ant-turning-from-windfall-to-nightmare-for-its-global-investors">Bloomberg theorises that</a>:</p><blockquote>China’s leaders have grown frustrated with the swagger of tech billionaires and want to teach them a lesson by killing off their businesses -- even if it means short-term pain for the economy and markets. <br><br>China’s private sector has maintained a delicate relationship with the Communist Party for decades, and has only recently been recognized as central to the nation’s future. Many commentators have attributed the recent crackdown on fintech companies to remarks Ma made at a conference in October, when he decried attempts to rein in the burgeoning field as short-sighted and outmoded. <br><br>Between them, Alibaba, Ant and Tencent commanded a combined market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion in November, surpassing state-owned behemoths such as Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd. as the country’s most valuable companies.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/china-tech-rulers.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="635" height="548" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/china-tech-rulers.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/china-tech-rulers.png 635w"></figure><p>In China, the Communist Party is the boss. If a sector, company or individual is becoming too influential it will come down on them hard, regardless of the consequences. Where will China's next Jack Ma immigrate before growing their new trillion-dollar business? The United States (Texas or Miami rather than California, <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/no-lessons-were-learned/">of course</a>)? Singapore? The now EU-free United Kingdom? I would say Australia but its politicians are <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/no-lessons-were-learned/">anti-tech</a> and I don't think the broadband is up to scratch.</p><h3 id="larry-summers-on-those-stimulus-cheques">Larry Summers on those stimulus cheques</h3><p>There's a lot I don't agree with when it comes to Larry Summers <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-27/larry-summers-trump-pelosi-2-000-stimulus-checks-are-a-mistake">but he's right</a> to be alert to the risks of the latest stimulus payments, which are equivalent to throwing gasoline on the COVID fire:</p><blockquote>The data are striking. Total employee compensation is now running only about $30 billion per month behind the pre-Covid baseline. Measures in the congressional stimulus bill to strengthen unemployment insurance and to support business will add about $150 billion a month to household income in order to replace all this loss. <br><br>The question is whether there is a rationale for further tax rebate of more than $200 billion a month over the next quarter. This would represent additional support equal to an additional seven times the loss of household wage and salary income over the next quarter. <br>... <br>But the existing stimulus bill is sufficient to elevate household income relative to the economy’s potential to abnormally high levels — unheard of during an economic downturn. With President Donald Trump’s add-on, we are in completely uncharted territory, with household incomes more than 15% above their normal level relative to economic potential. We frankly have no confident basis for judging how much and how fast this excess, and the pre-existing backlog of saving from the Cares Act, will be spent. There is the possibility of some overheating, particularly if the economy’s potential supply remains constrained by Covid protection measures.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/summers-income-gdp.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="733" height="448" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/summers-income-gdp.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/summers-income-gdp.png 733w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As I've <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/it-has-been-a-long-five-months/">written before</a>, governments seem to have responded to the COVID recession, which has so far been mostly a supply shock, by:</p><blockquote>...trying to stimulate demand. That has caused asset prices to go ballistic, in large part because much of the stimulus is finding its way to relatively affluent people working from home, consuming less (i.e. saving more) and able to borrow significantly more.</blockquote><p>People are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yes-it-is-possible-to-have-too-much-stimulus-11609341559">cashed up</a>, they just can't or won't spend it due to pandemic-related restrictions or uncertainty. What they can spend it on are assets (look at property prices, Bitcoin and the Nasdaq Composite for examples), but as soon as they can, expect some of it to start trickling into consumer goods prices. Risk has been mispriced and resources are being misallocated, but by the time the central bankers and politicians realise <s>their error</s> the greedy capitalists' error, it'll be too late.</p><h3 id="yglesias-goes-off-the-deep-end">Yglesias goes off the deep end</h3><p>Former Vox economics/politics writer Matthew Yglesias had a <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1344118280441765889">few choice tweets</a> on Section 230, essentially agreeing with Donald Trump who has long lambasted the protections it provides to social media platforms.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/yglesias-tweets-s230.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="593" height="721"></figure><p>For someone who purports to write about economics those are extremely naïve comments. Essentially, Yglesias is arguing that:</p><ul><li>the government should concern itself with advertising revenue flows, despite no evidence of monopoly (i.e. become extremely interventionist in picking winners and losers); and</li><li>Facebook - with a market capitalisation of $775 billion and annual revenue over $70 billion - generates "essentially none" of the societal value created by Silicon Valley and the IT industry.</li></ul><p>I personally don't like Facebook but unlike Yglesias I'm wise enough to know that it creates enormous value for millions of people around the world, evidenced by the fact they use it more than the many alternatives available to them, including print media. Destroying Facebook and the value it creates would therefore <em>ipso facto</em> be bad for the country.</p><p>But it gets worse. If Yglesias gets his way and cripples Facebook, it will not accomplish his goal of redirecting revenue flows to journalism companies or individuals such as himself. Most of the advertisers on Facebook are small businesses - there are <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/30/tech/facebook-ad-business-boycott/index.html">more than 8 million</a> of them - with <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2019/Q1/Q1-'19-earnings-call-transcript-(1).pdf">less than 20%</a> of Facebook's advertising revenue coming from its top 100 clients. If Facebook can no longer offer targeted, localised adverts, how likely is it that your local baker, jewellery maker or coffee shop will simply "redirect" their Facebook advertising spend to journalism companies such as Vox or the New York Times? Facebook's top 100 clients, certainly, but not the remaining 7,999,900, who would all be harmed by no longer having Facebook adverts as an option.</p><p>Crippling Facebook by removing Section 230 is bad policy, not because Yglesias' stated goal of of wanting to support journalism companies is bad but because it's an ineffective, socially and economically destructive way to achieve that goal.</p><h3 id="astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-approved">AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine approved</h3><p>For all of its mishaps in its handling of the pandemic, the UK is at least <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-30/astra-oxford-covid-vaccine-gains-first-clearance-with-u-k-nod">leading the way</a> in terms of ending the crisis (how long until the EU bureaucrats get moving?):</p><blockquote>AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine won U.K. clearance, marking the first approval worldwide. <br><br>The shot can be deployed swiftly because it’s easier to transport and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech one, requiring only refrigerator temperatures rather than deep freezing. <br><br>A first dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine will be given to as many people as possible, followed by a second dose four to 12 weeks later. A government advisory group said the priority should be to vaccinate large numbers as quickly as possible rather than completing a two-dose regimen right away.</blockquote><p>👏👏👏 The AstraZeneca vaccine, if effective, is important as it's a key part of many countries' vaccination plans (see the dark blue bars in the image below, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3a37c3f5-20fc-4d1f-8dd4-2fd966c27542">courtesy of the FT</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/vaccine-orders.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/vaccine-orders.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/vaccine-orders.png 700w"></figure><p>Of course, none of that matters if the vaccine cannot be properly administered. Israel is the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-vaccination-doses-per-capita">clear leader</a> in that regard, with 10% of its population already vaccinated. By contrast, the US has vaccinated just .95% of its population with the UK at about 1.4%.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I trust everyone had a Merry Christmas! To wrap up 2020 I thought I'd provide a summary of some privacy-friendly software I use on a regular basis, just in case anyone felt the need to improve their risk profile in the new year.</p><h3 id="password-management">Password management</h3><p>Getting (and using) a password manager is the single biggest step you can take to improve your digital privacy and security. A password manager will generate a unique password for every service you use up to 128 characters long. You only need to remember one password* (or better yet, <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">a passphrase</a>) to unlock everything. That means if a company gets compromised - which happens <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">far, far too often</a> - at least all your other accounts are safe.</p><p><em>*Note that ideally you should combine your password/phrase with 2-factor authentication, such as an app like </em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp"><em>andOTP</em></a><em> or </em><a href="https://authy.com/"><em><s>Authy</s></em></a><em> <a href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis</a>.</em></p><p>In terms of which password manager to use, look no further than <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>. It's open source, has a very usable free option and will automatically sync with all of your devices. Here's a sample 32-character password I generated:</p><p><code>RNgs%BY7!*zu^HHPiHQsK$56iZLf!zgR</code></p><p>And here's a random 5-word passphrase I asked it to cook up:</p><p><code>excavate-daredevil-bobsled-sheep-ritalin</code></p><p>If you were really keen you could use <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> but I find Bitwarden's simplicity and ease-of-use impossible to beat, except perhaps by 'premium' managers such as 1Password, which are closed source so drop down my list a bit.</p><h3 id="file-synchronisation-and-cloud-storage">File synchronisation and cloud storage</h3><p>Dropbox, iCloud and Google Drive are great but not only do they scan and index your files, employees (and governments) can come snooping too. There are two clear privacy-friendly alternatives, one is free and requires a bit of technical nous while the other involves forking out a bit for a premium service.</p><p>The free option is <a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a>. It's open source and encrypts all of your data locally, meaning whichever mainstream cloud provider you use will only see gibberish when they scan your files.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/cryptomator-file-names.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="684" height="169" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/cryptomator-file-names.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/cryptomator-file-names.png 684w"></figure><p>The downside of using Cryptomator is that it makes collaboration impossible, including sharing file links. It also adds an element of risk - if you lose your passphrase or somehow corrupt your Cryptomator folder, you lose your data (always use a password manager!).</p><p>That downside can be resolved by using a paid service such as <a href="https://tresorit.com/">Tresorit</a>, <a href="https://sync.com">Sync.com</a>, <a href="https://mega.nz">Mega</a> or ProtonDrive. I haven't tried <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/proton-drive-early-access/">ProtonDrive</a> as it's only in beta but the other three work at least as well as the big mainstream cloud providers. Note that Mega and Sync are based in New Zealand and Canada respectively, which are both members of the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">five eyes</a>' and so should be avoided where possible. That leaves Tresorit, which has been around quite a while now and is based in Switzerland (with relatively good privacy laws). However, as with the other three its source code is not open, meaning there's still an element of trust involved.</p><p>The only other options that tick all the boxes are <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> or <a href="https://www.seafile.com/en/home/">Seafile</a>. But those are self-hosted solutions so require a bit of technical ability and either a paid virtual private server (VPS), a dedicated server in your home or someone else to manage it.</p><h3 id="email">Email</h3><p>This is an area where I have flip-flopped a few times over the years. I have found that encrypted email - e.g. ProtonMail, Tutanota - might sound good on paper, but you usually have to sacrifice too much for limited gains.</p><p>The ability to sync contacts to your phone's address book? Someday, maybe. Properly formatted emails? Occasionally. Calendar invites? If you're lucky!</p><p>While end-to-end encrypted email sounds nice, it's better in theory than in practice. Aside from the relatively limited features, just about every email you send or receive will have Apple, Google or Microsoft on the other end of it anyway, meaning they already have a copy of most of your emails. That means there's very little point to end-to-end encrypted email; it's simply not the right medium for privacy.</p><p>However, you should still try to avoid the Google's of the world where you can. Despite the pitfalls, encrypted services such as ProtonMail are good in the sense that you can be sure they do the basics well, including zero-access encryption at rest and 2-factor authentication. They're also good if you regularly email someone else willing to use PGP, such as a spouse or colleagues.</p><p>I personally have accounts with Swiss-based ProtonMail and Iceland-based <a href="https://runbox.com/">Runbox</a>, using the open source clients <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a> (Desktop) and K-9 Mail (<a href="https://forum.k9mail.app/t/how-do-i-become-a-beta-tester/68">Android beta version</a>) with the latter as its web interface leaves much to be desired. Other options I have dabbled with over the years include <a href="https://mailbox.org/en/">mailbox.org</a>, <a href="https://soverin.net/">Soverin</a>, <a href="https://mailfence.com/">Mailfence</a> and <a href="https://www.startmail.com/en/">StartMail</a>. YMMV, so make sure to use your own domain name (@yourname.com) to make switching providers easy should the need arise.</p><h3 id="messaging">Messaging</h3><p>While the email protocol was not built for privacy, messaging was. The standout is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol">Signal Protocol</a>, which is what secures the <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal Messenger</a> and a bunch of other major encryption implementations from WhatsApp to Skype chat.</p><p>However, of the available encrypted messaging options only Signal Messenger is open source. Facebook claims that WhatsApp uses the Signal Protocol but there is no way to guarantee it's actually working, or that it hasn't subsequently backdoored it.</p><p>To keep a long story short, try to use Signal Messenger whenever possible. It only has two weaknesses, namely that:</p><ol><li>it's centralised, meaning there's a single point of failure in the Signal Foundation's servers; and</li><li>it requires a mobile phone number, which may not be practical for some people.</li></ol><p>If either of those two weaknesses are a major issue for you, consider using <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>, which provides end-to-end encrypted chats over the decentralised, federated <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix network</a>.</p><h3 id="social-media">Social media</h3><p>There's no good answer here. All of the mainstream networks - Facebook and Instagram, Twitter, SnapChat, TikTok, WeChat - are in fact advertising companies masquerading as social media platforms. They don't charge you anything because you're the product, not the client. Privacy is non-existent on these services so other than abstinence, there's no easy way to avoid having all of your information gobbled up by them.</p><p>While you could sign up for an account on the <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/portal/servers">Fediverse</a>, good luck convincing anyone to join you (incidentally I <a href="https://detrended.net">run my own Pleroma node</a>).</p><p>All I can say here is that if you must use the likes of Facebook and Twitter, at least use an open source client on your mobile such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mariotaku.twidere">Twidere</a> or <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.pitchedapps.frost/">Frost for Facebook</a> (the latter requires <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/">F-Droid</a>, an app store containing only free and open source software on Android), which will prevent these companies from listening in on your microphone and harvesting everything else you might have on your phone.</p><h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3><p>I use <a href="https://antennapod.org/">AntennaPod</a>, an open source podcast manager that can index podcasts from all of the popular websites or RSS feeds.</p><h3 id="note-taking">Note taking</h3><p>For mobile and desktop note taking I use <a href="https://standardnotes.org/">Standard Notes</a>, which is open source and end-to-end encrypted. It's simple but does the trick and will automatically sync with all of your devices.</p><h3 id="web-browser">Web browser</h3><p>The best of a bad bunch is Firefox with the uBlock origin add-on (make sure to also check the option to prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses). I say a bad bunch because Firefox has been horribly mismanaged by the Mozilla Foundation, which for whatever reason prioritises myriad of <a href="http://calpaterson.com/mozilla.html">side projects</a> at the expense of its most important product, Firefox. Even if you wanted to donate specifically to improve Firefox, it goes into general revenue so there's a good chance the Mozilla Foundation will instead use it to increase its CEO's pay or finance some whacky side project, such as the creation of an AI division.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/mozilla-boss-pay.svg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="614" height="461"></figure><h3 id="vpn">VPN</h3><p>You should use a VPN whenever it's convenient to do so. The most important features are that it doesn't keep logs and is based in a country that you do not reside within. You generally get what you pay for with a VPN and I'd recommend the Sweden-based <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad</a> (or if you use ProtonMail for email, bundle it with <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN</a>).</p><p>Have a Happy New Year!</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is this the beginning of the end for the so-called neobanks? Australian neobank Xinja last week closed all of its bank accounts, issued refunds and handed back its banking licence. It was burning cash trying to acquire customers but didn't have anything to sell them. Sounds like a <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/xinja-dumped-auditor-struggled-to-deliver-services-prior-to-fall-20201217-p56oaf.html">bit of a Ponzi</a>:</p><blockquote>Corporate documents, obtained by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, show Sydney-based firm Grant Thornton ceased to be Xinja’s auditor in April, with its last financial statement warning the neobank temporarily breached its minimum capital requirements. <br><br>Grant Thorton said Xinja’s cash flow relied on “injections of additional capital” to maintain a buffer above Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s requirements to continue operating lawfully. The report also noted the group needed to cut costs and expand products to stay afloat. <br><br>“Should the above transactions or assumptions not materialise, there is a material uncertainty whether the group will continue as a going concern,” Grant Thornton’s auditors warned. <br><br>Seven days later, Grant Thorton ceased to be Xinja’s auditor and was replaced by big four auditing firm PwC.</blockquote><p>I know words like 'neobank' tend to get people excited but there's really nothing 'neo' (new) about them, other than the lack of a physical branch. It would be like Amazon branding itself a 'neoretailer'; i.e. pure marketing BS. In their current form, neobanks are just boring old banks. End of discussion.</p><p>That's not to say neobanks don't exist. But they're being built on the blockchain - stablecoins and DeFi, or decentralised finance, are where the neobanks will be. Dressing up the same old traditional banks sans retail branches with some expensive marketing, a decent app and a fancy card just doesn't cut it, especially when you need to offer above-market rates to attract deposits that you can't properly utilise.</p><h3 id="please-use-a-decent-password-manager-">Please, use a decent password (manager)</h3><p>Twice in the past week it was reported that critical systems were "hacked". But it's a generous use of the word - in both cases, it was simply a case of human error. Namely, using a sh***ty password.</p><p>First there was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/16/trumps-twitter-account-was-hacked-dutch-ministry-affirms">Donald Trump's twitter account</a>, which was kind of a big deal because it's how he conducts everything from diplomacy to policy:</p><blockquote>Dutch prosecutors have confirmed that Donald Trump’s Twitter account was hacked in October despite denials from Washington and the company, but said the “ethical hacker” would not face charges.  The hacker, named as Victor Gevers, broke into Trump’s account @realDonaldTrump on 16 October by guessing the US president’s password, Dutch media reports said... Gevers, 44, disclosed the hack immediately, saying the password he guessed was “maga2020!”, referring to the Trump slogan “Make America Great Again”.</blockquote><p>Next up was the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c13dbb51-907b-4db7-8347-30921ef931c2">SolarWinds breach</a>, a US company that "develops software for businesses to help manage their networks, systems, and information technology infrastructure". It turns out SolarWinds does a lot of work for, and has a lot of access to, the networks of key US government bureaucracies <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/12/a-very-simple-breakdown-of-the-very-bad-solarwinds-security-breach/">including</a> the Treasury, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Department of Energy and even the National Nuclear Security Administration.</p><p>The "hack" occurred because SolarWinds used the <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/318430-security-researcher-solarwinds123-password-left-firm-vulnerable-in-2019">super secure password</a> <em>solarwinds123 </em>(yes, all lowercase), which once discovered allowed the attackers to push an update to their clients loaded with malware, in many cases granting them full network access.</p><p>Insanity? You might think so. But if you've ever worked in a large organisation or government entity, stupid passwords are the norm. Rather than requiring a password manager, hardware token or two-factor authentication (or some combination of the three), management at these organisations - themselves technically illiterate - seem content to use the default Microsoft corporate security policy, which amounts to forcing people to append their stupid password with an ever-increasing number of digits every few months.</p><p>Microsoft, by the way, is also a big client of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-breach/suspected-russian-hacking-spree-used-another-major-tech-supplier-sources-idUSKBN28R2ZJ">SolarWinds</a>.</p><h3 id="speaking-of-slow-moving-organisations-">Speaking of slow moving organisations...</h3><p>It took the US Army <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a35004952/army-face-masks-slow-development-time/">nearly a year</a> to develop a... cloth face mask. Apparently that was a good effort - it was accomplished on an “expedited timeline”. </p><blockquote>U.S. Army soldiers will soon be wearing a new face mask designed to protect them from COVID-19. The Army developed the Combat Cloth Face Covering (CCFC), which is visibly no different from commercial masks designed and brought to market within days of the pandemic, on what the service calls an “expedited timeline.”<br><br>But the glacially slow development is yet another dysfunctional procurement program from a service that takes years to purchase something as simple as a handgun.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/us-army-facemask.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="632" height="305" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/us-army-facemask.jpg 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/us-army-facemask.jpg 632w"></figure><p>You could not make this up. Meanwhile, “[private sector] clothing designers and personal protective equipment manufacturers quickly came up with designs that were immediately put into mass production. Within weeks, millions of people worldwide could easily obtain effective masks”.</p><p>I sure am glad the military has nothing to do with vaccine development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Australian government unveiled its <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6652">55-page</a> <em>News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code</em> last week, designed to force Facebook and Google to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-regulator/australia-to-make-facebook-google-pay-news-outlets-for-content-idUSKBN28I0E3">pay local news outlets</a> for content excerpts displayed on their platforms:</p><blockquote>Australia finalised plans on Tuesday to make Facebook Inc and Google pay its media outlets for news content, a world-first move aimed at protecting independent journalism that has been strongly opposed by the internet giants. <br><br>Under laws to go to parliament this week, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the Big Tech firms must negotiate payments for content that appears on their platforms with local publishers and broadcasters. If they can’t strike a deal, a government-appointed arbitrator will decide for them.</blockquote><p>I've opposed this from the start because Google and Facebook aren't "taking their news content without paying for it", as Denis Muller from the University of Melbourne's Centre for Advancing Journalism put it. Users on their platforms are posting links, which also include a thumbnail image and a short excerpt (similar to the Reuters link below). Presumably local media complained that people cared so little about the actual article that they never clicked it, depriving them of advertising revenue.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-regulator/australia-to-make-facebook-google-pay-news-outlets-for-content-idUSKBN28I0E3"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Australia to make Facebook, Google pay news outlets for content</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Australia finalised plans on Tuesday to make Facebook Inc and Google pay its media outlets for news content, a world-first move aimed at protecting independent journalism that has been strongly opposed by the internet giants.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://www.reuters.com/article/_next/static/images/favicon-196x196-052cc719f1ac872e3544e51801338b46.png"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Reuters</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">ron Kaye</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m&#x3D;02&amp;d&#x3D;20201208&amp;t&#x3D;2&amp;i&#x3D;1543770590&amp;r&#x3D;LYNXMPEGB706V&amp;w&#x3D;800"></div></a></figure><p>Fortunately the legislation has been watered down to the point where it will likely cause fewer distortions. <a href="https://theconversation.com/expect-delays-and-power-plays-google-and-facebook-brace-as-news-media-bargaining-code-is-set-to-become-law-151690">This new concession</a> is key:</p><blockquote>...the revised code will now abide by an added “two-way value exchange” principle. This allows the monetary worth of traffic sent to news providers to be taken into account when determining the financial value of a particular news business’s content to the platforms. <br><br>[Another] concession is the halving of the 28-day notice period for the platforms to warn news websites of major changes to their ranking algorithms. These directly impact how news articles are displayed on Facebook’s Newsfeed and Google Search.</blockquote><p>I suspect those new concessions, and the possibility of further concessions to come, mean that Facebook and Google will continue to operate in Australia. It could even prove profitable for Facebook and Google, should the new arbitration process (when no agreement can be reached prior) value the aggregate clicks that Facebook and Google deliver to local news outlets as greater than the value of the social media excerpts.</p><p>But what <em>really</em> irks me is that the Australian government is wasting everyone's time with this kind of protectionist clap-trap following a recession and ongoing global pandemic. This is a government whose drastic and <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/it-has-been-a-long-five-months/">ill-conceived</a> pandemic sending is expected to send net debt up more than <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-09/federal-budget-2020-debt-deficit-blowout-explained/12741472">twofold</a>. I just wish it would spend more time on <em>removing </em>activity-stifling constraints such as this proposed legislation. But no, it seems behind the scenes they've <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australian-economy/designer-rugs-1000-chairs-and-minecraft-how-your-tax-dollars-are-being-spent-during-covid19/news-story/4e4860891d8415554983db741d543400">carried on</a> as if nothing has changed, looking to dive ever deeper into their assault on technology and innovation in Australia.</p><p>Alas, that is how the political incentives line up. Beat your chest pretending to be looking out for the consumer (who clearly prefer Facebook and Google's summaries) when really all you're doing is supporting your mates called Murdoch, Stokes and Packer at the consumer's expense.</p><h3 id="speaking-of-suffocating-regulation-wither-california">Speaking of suffocating regulation, wither California?</h3><p>Elon Musk last week announced he was <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-critical-of-california-leaves-the-state-and-moves-to-texas">no longer a resident of California</a>, opting to live in Texas instead: </p><blockquote>"You have a forest of redwoods and the little trees can’t grow", in the interview, which took place during the Wall Street Journal’s annual CEO Council Summit, Musk said, "California has been winning for a long time, and I think they’re taking it for granted".</blockquote><p>Musk has long had beef with California, which back in May reached boiling point after Musk threatened to move the Tesla plant out of California and said he was going to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-los-angeles-homes-real-estate-portfolio-photos">sell all of his physical possessions</a>, mostly Californian houses. His threat was met by this <a href="https://twitter.com/LorenaSGonzalez/status/1259287879177531392">delightful tweet</a> from California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/lorena-gonzalez.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="649" height="227" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/lorena-gonzalez.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/lorena-gonzalez.png 649w"></figure><p>One billionaire moving to Texas isn't the end of the world for California. But a <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2020/12/11/oracle-is-the-latest-silicon-valley-company-to-head-for-the-hills-of-austin-texas/">pattern is starting to emerge</a>:</p><blockquote>HP Enterprise also announced earlier this month that it would relocate its headquarters from San Jose to the Houston suburb of Spring. Palantir Technologies relocated from Palo Alto this year, landing in Denver. The tech giants Google and Apple have been expanding their presence in Austin over the last several years... [Now] Oracle Corp. is the latest Silicon Valley-based company to exit California amidst the pandemic with plans to shift its headquarters to Austin.  The $39 billion-a-year tech giant announced the headquarters move in a regulatory filing after stock markets closed Friday.</blockquote><p>That wouldn't be a problem, except California - the state with the highest state-level sales tax rate at 7.25% - needs all the businesses and taxpayers <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/debt-by-state">it can get</a>:</p><blockquote>California has the fifth-highest debt of any state... Combining California’s federal, state, and local debt, however, brings California’s debt total to over $1 trillion. According to this <a href="https://californiapolicycenter.org/californias-total-state-local-debt-totals-1-3-trillion/">report</a>, the debt would cost each resident of California $33,000 or each taxpayer $74,000.</blockquote><p>Relatively nice weather can only get you so far. Perhaps a good place to start would be for California's elected officials to stop flinging expletives at <em>any</em> of its residents, even those big bad billionaires.</p><h3 id="the-antitrust-lawyers-want-to-break-up-facebook">The antitrust lawyers want to break up Facebook</h3><p>Facebook was hit with an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-lawsuit-by-federal-trade-commission-state-attorneys-general-11607543139">antitrust lawsuit</a> last week:</p><blockquote>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 46 states sued Facebook Inc. on Wednesday, accusing the social-media giant of buying and freezing out small startups to choke competition. <br><br>The FTC’s sweeping antitrust case seeks to force Facebook to unwind its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, two of its landmark deals. The states filed a separate and similar lawsuit, alleging a lack of competition has harmed consumers, including by weakening privacy protections.</blockquote><p>Regular readers know I don't like (and don't use) Facebook. But I don't support this lawsuit. This is the politicisation of antitrust, nothing more, nothing less. Facebook does not have a monopoly: has the FTC not heard of TikTok (it's not mentioned once in its 53-page complaint)? Snapchat? <em>Google?!</em> (remember Facebook is first and foremost an advertising company, not a social media platform). Its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were also <em>approved by the very same FTC</em>. Nothing has changed since then, except the people in charge of the FTC (political appointees).</p><p>Sigh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How the world has changed. I'm not going to attempt to cover everything that has happened since the <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/congress-big-tech-bluster/">last issue</a>, but there are a few items that stand out.</p><p>First, the good.</p><p>US President Donald Trump failed to eliminate Section 230 and won't get another opportunity to undermine online free speech. As an added bonus, he decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1334718387583377408">veto a bloated military bill</a> out of spite. A double win!</p><p>Then there's the fact that the human race has managed to concoct not just one but four COVID-19 vaccine candidates in record time - we're talking less than a year from conception to delivery. Better yet, two of the more promising use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine">messenger RNA</a> technology never before seen in a commercial vaccine for humans and may have implications well beyond COVID-19. How good is that? With any luck, life will return to something resembling normal within a year.</p><p>Now, the (much more extensive) bad. </p><p>The coronavirus is still running rampant through most parts of the world, as people suffered pandemic fatigue and <em>couldn't possibly skip that European summer vacation or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/visualization-shows-massive-amount-of-planes-still-flying-thanksgiving-week-2020-11">Thanksgiving travel</a></em>, even with a vaccine only months away. The United States is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">now facing</a> its biggest wave of the virus to date:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/us-covid-dec20.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="621" height="671" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/us-covid-dec20.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/us-covid-dec20.png 621w"></figure><p>In response, governments and central banks around the world have again pulled out the Keynesian playbook, responding to what is mostly a supply shock by trying to stimulate demand. That has caused asset prices to go ballistic, in large part because much of the stimulus is finding its way to relatively affluent people working from home, consuming less (i.e. saving more) and able to borrow significantly more:</p><blockquote>"Buoyed by record-low borrowing costs, average house prices [in New Zealand] surged an annual 8% in October. It’s a dynamic that’s emerging in other countries — even those that are yet to get the pandemic under control. U.K. prices hit a record even as it braced for new restrictions. In the U.S., house prices posted the biggest annual jump in seven years in the third quarter. Meanwhile in Australia, home prices rose for the first time in six months in October." <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-11-20/bloomberg-australia-another-casualty-of-china-tensions">Source</a>.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/bb-nz-property.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="620" height="348" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/bb-nz-property.jpg 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/bb-nz-property.jpg 620w"></figure><p>Among advanced economies, coronavirus-related fiscal spending <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1107572/covid-19-value-g20-stimulus-packages-share-gdp/">ranges</a> from over 20% of GDP in Japan to a more conservative but still large 9% in Germany. That will, at some point, have to be repaid. It's also unlikely to come with the future productivity benefits that other types of government spending can typically have (e.g. certain infrastructure). It might also create some inflationary pressure once people are able to actually spend it on various consumer goods and services again. More on that below. 👇</p><p>The fiscal response has been more than matched by monetary policy, which is what's really driving asset price inflation in everything from Tesla stock to Kiwi houses and even cryptocurrency. A quick look around the world will show you that Canada's central bank increased its balance sheet five-fold; Australia's two-fold; the US' 70%; the euro area's 50%; and Japan's 25%. All in the span of a few months. What could possibly go wrong?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/nasdaq-dec20-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1033" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/nasdaq-dec20-1.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/nasdaq-dec20-1.png 1000w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/nasdaq-dec20-1.png 1600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/12/nasdaq-dec20-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Don't expect anything to change soon, either. Central bankers have been very vocal about suppressing interest rates for, in some cases, up to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-03/rba-cuts-interest-rates-record-low-coronavirus-pandemic/12838760">three years</a>. Whether they'll be able to achieve that stated goal is another question, but you can be sure they'll try for far longer than they should.</p><p>But the sheer amount of demand stimulus being injected into the global economy can't go on forever and when it turns, it'll turn quickly. As Hemingway wrote in <em>The Sun Also Rises,</em> you go bankrupt in two ways: "Gradually, then suddenly." That's probably how the latest global debt adventure will also unfold: first with asset price inflation, then with the wealth effect pushing up consumer price inflation, then finally with a sudden crisis as markets, central bankers and governments eventually realise their errors (far too late).</p><p>Unfortunately, the madness may continue for much longer than you expect (such is the nature of credit booms).</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the heads of every Big Tech company - Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google - appeared before Congress to defend themselves against possible antitrust action. Long story short, despite <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/antitrust-finally-gets-its-hearing-267252">ample evidence being tabled</a> (1.3 million documents!) and 217 questions over 6 hours, the House Judiciary Committee's investigation is unlikely to amount to anything.</p><p>Why? Because there is still no evidence of monopoly, such as market dominance (properly defined) and consumer harm through the form of higher prices and restricted supply. If anything, Big Tech has provided people with more options at a lower price.</p><p>I know that the lack of anything concrete won't deter lawmakers but it should at least temper their expectations. Markets certainly believe the worst is over, with Big Tech's respective share prices barely changed following the hearing, being swamped by third quarter earnings reports released only a day later:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/08/congress-big-tech.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1184" height="504" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/congress-big-tech.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/congress-big-tech.png 1000w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/08/congress-big-tech.png 1184w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="however-google-has-problems">However, Google has problems</h3><p>Not just because the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-doj/u-s-state-attorneys-general-likely-to-bring-antitrust-lawsuits-against-google-source-idUSKBN22R37I">is expected</a> to file a lawsuit against its dominance in digital advertising, but because Google has a <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/07/30/googles-problems-are-bigger-than-just-the-antitrust-case">management issue</a>:</p><blockquote>Mr Pichai’s foremost challenge is to prevent Alphabet from becoming what Mr Brin and Mr Page were so bent on avoiding—a “conventional company” that dies a slow death from lack of innovation and declining growth. The task is as delicate as the technology giant is gargantuan. <br><br>Today Alphabet is a conglomerate of businesses that sometimes appear to have little in common—a corporate planetary system or Googleverse, if you will. Commercially, its centre of gravity is Google itself, and particularly its online-advertising business. This generates 83% of the group’s revenue and all its profits. <br>... <br>Online advertising overall is far from a mature market, but growth in search ads, which continue to generate about 60% of Alphabet’s revenues, has slowed. In 2019 sales expanded by 15%, a healthy clip but considerably lower than the 22% a year earlier. General online search is also being “hollowed out” by specialised searches, says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a research firm. Mr Shmulik estimates that about 60% of product searches now start on Amazon (whose fast-growing online-ad business is already the world’s third-biggest behind Google and Facebook). <br>... <br>Although Mr Brin, Mr Page and Mr Schmidt remain Alphabet’s biggest individual shareholders—with 13.1% of shares and 56.7% of voting rights—a former senior executive says that the company is now run by a different triumvirate. Besides Mr Pichai it includes Kent Walker, senior vice-president of global affairs, and Ruth Porat, the finance chief poached from Morgan Stanley, an investment bank. Where Mr Brin and Mr Page were technologists and Mr Schmidt a technologist-manager, the new team are simply managers.</blockquote><p>Google is now run by investment bankers and appears to be biting off more than it can chew in a million other areas as its core business, advertising, is being eroded. Will they notice in time? This is a bigger issue for Google than the Justice Department.</p><h3 id="success-is-by-no-means-guaranteed">Success is by no means guaranteed</h3><p>Jeff Bezos' <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/statement-by-jeff-bezos-to-the-u-s-house-committee-on-the-judiciary">prepared statement</a> was excellent, and is example #5623 why success is by no means guaranteed:</p><blockquote>Amazon's success was anything but preordained. Investing in Amazon early on was a very risky proposition. From our founding through the end of 2001, our business had cumulative losses of nearly $3 billion, and we did not have a profitable quarter until the fourth quarter of that year. Smart analysts predicted Barnes &amp; Noble would steamroll us, and branded us “Amazon.toast.” In 1999, after we’d been in business for nearly five years, Barron’s headlined a story about our impending demise “Amazon.bomb.” My annual shareholder letter for 2000 started with a one-word sentence: “Ouch.” At the pinnacle of the internet bubble our stock price peaked at $116, and then after the bubble burst our stock went down to $6. Experts and pundits thought we were going out of business. It took a lot of smart people with a willingness to take a risk with me, and a willingness to stick to our convictions, for Amazon to survive and ultimately to succeed.</blockquote><p>Note that Amazon has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/30/amazon-struggles-coronavirus/"><em>lost</em> market share</a> since COVID-19 hit. The digital world is brutally competitive.</p><h3 id="microsoft-to-buy-tiktok">Microsoft to buy TikTok</h3><p>With a little help from the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/trump-says-he-will-ban-tiktok-through-executive-action-as-soon-as-saturday.html">US executive</a>:</p><blockquote>President Donald Trump on Friday told reporters he will act soon to ban Chinese-owned video app TikTok from the United States, NBC News reported. <br><br>Trump made the comments while chatting with reporters on Air Force One during the flight back to Washington from Florida. <br><br>“As far as TikTok is concerned we’re banning them from the United States,” Trump said, calling the action a “severance.” <br><br>Trump did not specify whether he will act through an executive order, or another method. such as a designation, according to NBC News. <br><br>“Well, I have that authority. I can do it with an executive order or that,” Trump said.</blockquote><p>Trump can't actually ban TikTok, but he can (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2eb1859f-ea08-4c7e-9bdd-a6712389a389">and has</a>) set the wheels in motion:</p><blockquote>“These Chinese software companies doing business in the United States, whether it’s TikTok or WeChat — there are countless more . . . are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist party, their national security apparatus,” Mr Pompeo told Fox News. <br><br>“President Trump has said 'enough' and we're going to fix it and so he will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist party.”</blockquote><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-aims-for-a-deal-to-buy-tiktoks-u-s-business-11596418842">looks set</a> to be the winner (provided the price is right):</p><blockquote>[Microsoft will] move quickly to pursue discussions with TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd. of Beijing and aims to complete the negotiations by Sept. 15. The statement, the software giant’s first confirmation it was interested in acquiring TikTok’s U.S. business, said the deal talks also entail the app’s service in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. <br><br>“Microsoft appreciates the U.S. Government’s and President Trump’s personal involvement as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country,” the company said in its statement. <br><br>It added it would ensure that the data of American TikTok users is transferred to the U.S., where it would remain. Microsoft said TikTok operations under its ownership would build on the popular user experience while adding privacy and security protections.</blockquote><p>Apparently discussions were taking place prior to Trump's statement, which nearly derailed the process. What has amazed me this whole time is how successful TikTok has been in the United States even with its dubious links to the Chinese government and <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/dont-use-tiktok/">dodgy stance</a> on privacy. The average person really, really doesn't care about those issues. National security though? Sure, because you don't actually need evidence.</p><p>Another question is, will Microsoft actually manage the acquisition properly? It famously botched video chat the last time it tried (Skype), despite have a 10-year head start over the competition. Might Microsoft's governance structures be too antiquated to manage a youth-focused, rising star in such a dynamic sector?</p><h3 id="australia-bans-news-articles-on-social-media">Australia bans news articles on social media</h3><p>Not quite, but that is one possible outcome of <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-31/draft-mandatory-code-conduct-facebook-google-pay-for-news/12510776">this proposed law</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook and Google will have to pay traditional news media to publish their content under a new code of conduct developed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) that could be implemented by the end of this year.</blockquote><p>These media platforms could be liable for <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/facebook-and-google-face-10m-for-media-code-breaches-20200731-p55h6p">up to $1 billion</a> per annum just for displaying news articles:</p><blockquote>Mr Sims would not comment on how much revenue Google and Facebook would be forced to share under the code, saying the ACCC had a number in mind but the negotiating parties might have very different ideas, so he did not want to prejudice talks. <br><br>Nine, owner of The Australian Financial Review, has previously said it believes the number is about 10 per cent of local revenue – about $600 million based on 2018 numbers in the Digital Platforms Inquiry. News Corp has suggested the number is closer to $1 billion.</blockquote><p>Why, you might ask? <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-regulator/australia-to-make-facebook-google-pay-for-news-in-world-first-idUSKCN24V3UP">Lobbying</a> by local media monopolists:</p><blockquote>Media companies including News Corp Australia, a unit of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, lobbied hard for the government to force the U.S. companies to the negotiating table amid a long decline in advertising revenue.</blockquote><p>If Big Tech play ball, this is just a protectionist subsidy for local media. But I don't think this will end the way News Corp thinks it will. Big Tech won't just hand over the $1 billion. If it goes ahead, the likes of Google and Facebook will stop showing news articles in Australia (a tiny market), News Corp's advertising revenue will be decimated and the media scene in Australia will become even more barren.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I say this a lot but the term artificial intelligence (AI) is designed to mislead. What people call AI is really just human-calibrated algorithms scanning enormous datasets for the most appropriate response. It's great for certain things - such as loading containers on a ship - but not so good at, say, driving on roads with pesky, unpredictable humans.</p><p>For some, the ambiguity can be profitable. Take ScaleFactor, which promised "artificial intelligence-powered tools that could replace the accountant", and raised over $100m prior to COVID-19. Turns out it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/07/20/scalefactor-raised-100-million-in-a-year-then-blamed-covid-19-for-its-demise-employees-say-it-had-much-bigger-problems/">snake oil</a>:</p><blockquote>Instead of software producing financial statements, dozens of accountants did most of it manually from ScaleFactor’s Austin headquarters or from an outsourcing office in the Philippines, according to former employees. Some customers say they received books filled with errors, and were forced to re-hire accountants, or clean up the mess themselves.</blockquote><p>Then there's OpenAI, a company which last week launched "GPT-3" (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3), its latest AI model that had even the normally sensible economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-21/artificial-intelligence-offers-the-hope-2020-needs">salivating</a>:</p><blockquote>This year is likely to be remembered for the Covid-19 pandemic and for a significant presidential election, but there is a new contender for the most spectacularly newsworthy happening of 2020: the unveiling of GPT-3. <br>... <br>The core of GPT-3, which is a creation of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence company based in San Francisco, is a general language model designed to perform autofill. It is trained on uncategorized internet writings, and basically guesses what text ought to come next from any starting point. That may sound unglamorous, but a language model built for guessing with 175 billion parameters — 10 times more than previous competitors — is surprisingly powerful.</blockquote><p>Let's put aside the fact that there is nothing open about OpenAI - GPT-3 is closed source and provided via a paid API - and instead focus on GPT-3 itself.</p><p>In terms of AI, GPT-3 is an enormous upgrade if for no other reason than the sheer number of parameters in its database (it has 175 billion versus say Google's T5, which had ~11 billion). But the fundamental technology is unchanged from anything in the last few years and as Tyler notes, GPT-3 does not try to pass the Turing test by being indistinguishable from a human in its responses. It's a big improvement on existing AI models, but it's not a step forward in terms of the technology nor in addressing the more fundamental flaws with AI that restrict its potential applications.</p><p>One of those applications is autonomous vehicles, which are being developed using similar AI technology to GPT-3, with the same limitations. But it seems the sector has finally acknowledged the reality of the situation, moving from the robotaxi dream to finding <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/96d3eeff-7f52-46e3-a8a8-aeb668472034">practical</a> uses for it:</p><blockquote>The sector is experiencing “autonomous disillusionment”, says Prescott Watson, principal at Maniv Mobility, an early-stage venture capital firm. Now, “the pitch is, ‘robotaxis are a pipe dream’, but let’s take this technology to do something more lucrative,” he adds. <br><br>Investors are still interested in autonomy but the focus has shifted towards practical services such as grocery delivery, automated warehouse robots, and autonomous functions restricted to highways.</blockquote><p>Highway automation is plausible with the current AI technology. You don't have to dodge the dog in the driveway (or worse, the toddler) like a robotaxi might, and authorities could even designate a specific lane for automated vehicles, as they currently do for buses. According to Chuck Price, chief product officer at TuSimple, the biggest autonomy start-up devoted to trucking:</p><blockquote>“Trucks go on a very predictable route, every day, all the time,” he says. “So if I want to build a profitable trucking business with autonomy, I map [the highway] from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Florida, and I’ve got billions of dollars of revenue available on that route.”</blockquote><p>I think it's wise to avoid the AI hype that surrounds products such as OpenAI's GPT-3 or Tesla robotaxis given the technology hasn't really progressed (note Elon Musk was a founder of OpenAI, which might explain its excellent marketing), but still be optimistic about the productivity improvements on offer when automation is properly-applied, such as to freight.</p><h3 id="rip-digital-tracing">RIP digital tracing</h3><p>It has been three months since Apple and Google released their contact tracing framework yet governments still can't get it right. Germany's app (built using the framework) somehow still cost <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23897486">~€20 million</a>. Ambiguous privacy policies have kept some users away. South Korea's database was exposed.</p><p>The only positive development lately is that Ireland donated the code for its COVID Tracker app (based on the Apple/Google framework) to the not-for-profit Linux Foundation. Hopefully some kind of completely decentralised, global tracing app will now be possible.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nearform.com/blog/ireland-donates-contact-tracing-app-to-linux-foundation/">Ireland donates the world’s most successful contact tracing app to the Linux Foundation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-ever-happened-digital-contact-tracing">What Ever Happened to Digital Contact Tracing?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/technology/korea-coronavirus-app-security.html">Major Security Flaws Found in South Korea Quarantine App</a></li></ul><h3 id="slack-tries-to-antitrust-microsoft">Slack tries to antitrust Microsoft</h3><p>No surprise that it's happening in Europe. When you can't compete ... sue?</p><blockquote>Slack surprised Microsoft with a competition complaint in Europe yesterday. After arguing for months that Microsoft Teams isn’t a true competitor to Slack and is more akin to Zoom, Slack finally admitted what was clear all along: Microsoft Teams is a competitor, and Slack is finding it hard to compete with Microsoft. It’s not a surprising admission, but if Slack is finding it hard to compete with Microsoft, then it’s going to face even greater headaches once Google finally gets its act together. After fumbling with communications apps for years, there are early signs that Google is now ready to take on Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.</blockquote><p>I do worry about the return of antitrust around the world. Formerly dynamic, boundary-pushing businesses are now hiring lawyers, economists and content moderators instead of developers. The end result will be the utilitisation of the sector.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335406/slack-microsoft-teams-competition-eu-complaint-google-comparison">The big winner in Slack’s Microsoft fight could be Google</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/03798bf5-cdec-438f-879f-f9db8a5b8a07">Slack files EU antitrust complaint against Microsoft</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-21/amazon-sets-new-lobbying-record-as-tech-antitrust-scrutiny-grows">Amazon Sets New Lobbying Record as Tech Antitrust Scrutiny Grows</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-hires-economists-to-help-argue-its-app-store-commissions-arent-anti-competitive/">Apple hires economists to help argue its App Store commissions aren't anti-competitive</a></li></ul><h3 id="genealogy-breach">Genealogy breach</h3><p>Please don't give your DNA away to a company or government.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you don't think China knows how US-style 'capitalism' works, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/technology/tiktok-washington-lobbyist.html">think again</a>:</p><blockquote>[TikTok], which one year ago had virtually no lobbying presence in the nation’s capital, has hired a small army of more than 35 lobbyists to work on its behalf, including one with deep ties to President Trump. <br>... <br>In the past three months, lobbyists working on behalf of TikTok have held at least 50 meetings with congressional staff and lawmakers, including those on top committees like commerce, judiciary and intelligence. Those meetings have included a slick presentation that includes an organizational chart showing that TikTok does not operate in China and that most of its top leaders reside in the United States and are American citizens. For instance, TikTok’s new chief executive, Kevin Mayer, a former executive of Disney, lives in Los Angeles, they say.</blockquote><p>TikTok is in the throes of the Chinese government. I suspect the Chinese strategy here is simply to delay any action by the US government until at least November (when the US has an election that may produce a less tariff-happy, nationalist-heavy administration). That certainly seems to be the United Kingdom's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/18/pressure-from-trump-led-to-5g-ban-britain-tells-huawei">strategy</a>:</p><blockquote>The British government privately told the Chinese technology giant Huawei that it was being banned from Britain’s 5G telecoms network partly for “geopolitical” reasons following huge pressure from President Donald Trump. <br>... <br>As part of the high-level behind-the-scenes contacts, Huawei was told that geopolitics had played a part, and was given the impression that it was possible the decision could be revisited in future, perhaps if Trump failed to win a second term and the anti-China stance in Washington eased.</blockquote><p>But that's easier said than done. I'm not sure how easy it will be to unwind these decisions (and there have been many). Even if Biden wins, November is still four months away and while supply chains are relatively rigid, a fair bit of adjustment has happened over the past few 'tariff war' years. Not just because of actual decisions, either; even the perception of elevated risks of doing business in China (and Hong Kong) as a foreign entity is enough to affect decision makers. And the attacks seem to be <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/15/politics/pompeo-presser-july-15/">intensifying</a>:</p><blockquote>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday announced visa restrictions on employees of Chinese technology companies, including Huawei, in the latest Trump administration move against Beijing. <br><br>The US "will impose visa restrictions on certain employees ... of Chinese technology companies like Huawei that provide material support to regimes engaging in human rights violations and abuses globally," Pompeo told reporters at a State Department press briefing, [but] did not elaborate on which employees would be targeted or how many people would be affected.</blockquote><p>China-sympathising 'morals only apply when they don't hurt movie sales' Hollywood also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-barr/attorney-general-barr-accuses-hollywood-big-tech-of-collaborating-with-china-idUSKCN24H2JT">copped some flak</a> from, you guessed it, William Barr:</p><blockquote>U.S. Attorney General William Barr took aim at Hollywood companies, including Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Thursday as well as large technology firms like Apple, Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft Corp over company actions with China. <br><br>“Corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the (Chinese Communist party),” Barr said. He added that Hollywood has routinely caved into pressure and censored their films “to appease the Chinese Communist Party.” <br><br>“I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day,” Barr said in a speech at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Michigan.</blockquote><p>I'm not sure how this will play out, except that the US administration's actions and rhetoric will likely intensify and wane in line with the polls, which are currently against Trump (although as 2016 showed, that doesn't necessarily mean anything). It will be difficult for China to hold out to November without copping some permanent damage, both from the public which might suddenly start caring about privacy and data security and the shift of global supply chains to more politically 'secure' countries.</p><h3 id="twitter-was-hacked">Twitter was hacked</h3><p>Centralised systems often have a single point of failure. Twitter's was remarkably vulnerable, with the administrative login information apparently 'stickied' in a Slack chat.</p><p>Twitter is lucky the hacker simply asked for Bitcoin rather than starting a diplomatic crisis. That in itself raises further questions - if you're in a position of power, say the US President, should you really be using a centralised social media system when some teenager or disgruntled employee could cause serious damage to your nation with a few clicks? Hillary Clinton was rightly chastised for using a personal, insecure email server in her apartment, but a 'verified', blue-tick Twitter account isn't much better (maybe blue-tick accounts should have to sign each tweet cryptographically, or perhaps the best solution is avoidance of centralised, single-point-of-failure systems altogether).</p><ul><li><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/">Who’s Behind Wednesday’s Epic Twitter Hack?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/a-catastrophe-at-twitter-263960">A catastrophe at Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-16/what-twitter-s-worst-hack-means-for-elliott-and-its-bottom-line">What Twitter's Worst Hack Means For Its Bottom Line</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-cyber-washington/twitter-stepped-up-search-to-fill-top-security-job-ahead-of-hack-idUSKCN24H2DG">Twitter stepped up search to fill top security job ahead of hack</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-unverified-takeover/">Twitter Is at Its Best When Verified Accounts Can’t Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 id="this-is-how-big-consultancies-work">This is how big consultancies work</h3><p>The Markup released an exposé on two big technology consulting companies, IBM and Deloitte. Apparently they were hired by states such as California to overhaul and modernise their unemployment payment systems but (1) have failed to deliver working systems and (2) continue to be paid to fix the mess:</p><blockquote>Some of those systems have struggled to keep up with the wave of claims across the country, leaving thousands of people without help. In some cases, the technology broke down; in others, the work was never even completed. But those companies continue to win contracts for improving unemployment systems, despite serious questions about the quality of their work.</blockquote><p>The states are acting surprised, with Florida governor Ron DeSantis describing "the overwhelmed system as 'a jalopy in the Daytona 500' and ordered an investigation into how the state could have paid so much for so little".</p><p>Hiring a big consultancy will usually get you little bag for your buck. The problem for governments is they have little choice: only big consultancies can meet all of the government's mandatory tendering requirements, which are theoretically in place to protect the taxpayer but in reality are there to support big consultancies. It also allows the bureaucrats making the decisions to deflect responsibility and avoid risks. After all, who could be blamed for hiring world renowned companies such as IBM or Deloitte?</p><ul><li><a href="https://themarkup.org/coronavirus/2020/07/16/unemployment-benefits-website-failures-deloitte-ibm">Companies Made Millions Building Unemployment Websites That Didn’t Work</a></li></ul><h3 id="regulation-proper-regulation">Regulation ≠ proper regulation</h3><p>"We need to regulate the [insert industry name here]!" Familiar? Regulation is a delicate fish and needs to be clear, succinct and well enforced. Unfortunately, it's usually vague, bloated and poorly enforced. It can also be easily captured by those it's supposedly designed to regulate (concentrated interests have a huge incentive to do so):</p><blockquote>Germany’s top financial supervisor received detailed warnings about deceptive financial practices at Wirecard AG starting in 2008 but repeatedly declined to investigate the allegations, turning instead against the accusers. <br>... <br>BaFin’s role includes ensuring that listed companies abide by securities law, for instance by communicating truthfully with their shareholders.

Here's the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/virus-tracing-apps-privacy.html">New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote>In fact, “the vast majority” of virus-tracing apps used by governments lack adequate security and “are easy for hackers” to attack, according to a recent software analysis by Guardsquare, a mobile app security company. <br><br>“It’s a cautionary tale for governments aggregating such an enormous amount of data,” said Claudio Guarnieri, the head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab, who identified the problems with the Qatari app.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/07/tracing-apps-privacy.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="600" height="524" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/07/tracing-apps-privacy.png 600w"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.guardsquare.com/en/blog/report-proliferation-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-exposes-significant-security-risks">Guardsquare</a></figcaption></figure><p>People will tolerate their data being siphoned off provided they're adequately compensated (e.g. a good search engine, email service, or social network).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now you have probably heard that the Indian government decided to ban TikTok, WeChat and 57 other Chinese apps. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">Officially</a>, the decision is due to the apps engaging in activities that threatened "national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India".</p><p>Unofficially, it's a not-so-subtle political attack on China that follows months of conflict between the two nations, most notably on the disputed Himalayan border where the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3091465/china-india-border-fight-latest-long-and-troubled-history">deadliest clash</a> in more than 50 years occurred in recent days. China does not have an immediate response because the Indian tech sector is relatively underdeveloped, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-30/india-s-app-ban-threatens-china-s-rise-as-a-global-tech-power">meaning</a> "bilateral trade heavily is weighted toward Chinese exports to India. Attempts to hurt India economically could blowback on Chinese companies".</p><p>But politics aside, Chinese apps are digital cancer and you should uninstall them as soon as possible. According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fxgi06/not_new_news_but_tbh_if_you_have_tiktiok_just_get/">reddit sleuth</a> who reversed engineered the app, "TikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, or your device... well, they're using it".</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/07/tiktok-how-to-3.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="574" height="611"></figure><p>TikTok was also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/25/tiktok-clipboard-access-ios-14-caught/">caught</a> scanning users' clipboards every few seconds, meaning it could harvest passwords and other sensitive information. That "feature" was supposedly in place to "identify repetitive, spammy behaviour". TikTok removed it shortly after it was exposed, but if you believe the official line then I have some magic beans to sell you.</p><p>Ultimately, any app that is owned by a Chinese company (e.g. TikTok) or has developers in China (e.g. Zoom) should be avoided at all costs. Regardless of how well meaning are the owners and/or developers, the Chinese government can and will compel them to spy on their users.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a dominant company with 75% market share that it achieved only by "misleading consumers and buying up rivals". Then, because of "network effects", it has become nearly impossible for any other company to overcome its lead. It "can collect monopoly rents, manage the flow of information to most of the nation, and engage in virtually unlimited surveillance into the foreseeable future".</p><p>That company is of course Facebook, as analysed by <a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/facebook-s-dominance-is-built-on-anti-competitive-behavior">Yale's Theodore Nierenberg Professor of Economics Fiona Morton</a>. If you were to take her analysis at its face value then the only logical conclusion - which Morton and her co-author David Dinielli also arrived at - would be some form of antitrust, "reversing past acquisitions and imposing a requirement that Facebook work in concert with other social networks".</p><p>The only problem is that the analysis is deeply, fundamentally flawed, and you don't need a <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/Roadmap%20for%20an%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Facebook.pdf">36-page paper</a> to realise how wrong it is.</p><p>First, Facebook doesn't collect <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1057%2F978-1-349-94848-2_430-1">monopoly rents</a> ("earned by firms that are able to restrict supply and/or increase prices without fear of attracting competitors"). Facebook provides its consumer service for free but has <em>lowered prices</em> and <em>improved quality</em> for people who want to advertise. It also faces <em>intense competition</em> not just from other social networks but from Google, television, newspapers, radio, blogs, billboards... essentially any platform that shows advertisements.</p><p>Second, consumers aren't harmed. Consumers have never had more news and media choices than they do today. <strong>Facebook doesn’t have a monopoly on people's attention.</strong> It may be good - very good - at capturing people's attention, but that's not the same thing as a monopoly. It has fiercely competed against other companies and simply done a better job to date.</p><p>Third and finally, the authors wish to impose "a requirement that Facebook work in concert with other social networks". But doing so would effectively set a standard to which <em>all</em> social networks - both present and potential - would have to conform. Such regulations would disproportionately benefit incumbents like Facebook, which can:</p><ol><li>more easily afford the compliance costs; and </li><li>already exist, so will fit whatever 'social network' compatibility definitions are established.</li></ol><p>Some future competitor may not be able to "work in concert" with Facebook because it's built entirely differently, with the regulations stifling its early development (perhaps even sufficiently long to allow Facebook to acquire it!).</p><p>The only part of the Yale paper that I agree with is that "network effects" make it more difficult to leave Facebook. Switching costs are real, but they're not infinite. If a better rat trap comes along you can be sure people will switch to it, just as they switched from MySpace to Facebook.</p><p>You can dislike Facebook (I certainly do). But antitrust is not the answer and if anything would likely work to cement whatever limited market power Facebook has.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attention governments that built coronavirus tracing apps using a centralised model: apologise to taxpayers, toss the code and start over with a decentralised framework (Apple and Google literally provided one for free) or go back to relying solely on manual contact tracing. The latest centralised tracing app catastrophe comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/norway-pulls-its-coronavirus-contacts-tracing-app-after-privacy-watchdogs-warning/">from Norway</a>:</p><blockquote>One of the first national coronavirus contacts-tracing apps to be launched in Europe is being suspended in Norway after the country’s data protection authority raised concerns that the software, called “Smittestopp,” poses a disproportionate threat to user privacy — including by continuously uploading people’s location.</blockquote><p>Norway's tracing app had a download rate of approximately 10% of the population, well below the levels to be of much use in contact tracing (for some reason people didn't want to install an app that centrally tracks them via GPS). But at least it worked, unlike Australia's <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2020-06-17/covidsafe-contact-tracing-app-test-documents-rated-poor-iphone/12359250">COVIDSafe</a> app, which doesn't function properly on iPhones and is still <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/17/covid-safe-app-australia-covidsafe-contact-tracing-australian-government-covid19-tracking-problems-working">riddled with bugs</a>:</p><blockquote>Documents released by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) reveal the app's ability to communicate between two locked iPhones was rated as "poor" as of April 26, which means at launch, its own tests suggested it logged encounters at a rate of 25 per cent or below. <br>... <br>One recently patched flaw allowed long-term tracing of phones even if the app was uninstalled. Although a patch fixed the issue, Android users may not be getting the most up-to-date app after developers noticed it would not auto-update if it was already running – a requirement for effective operation. <br><br>The Australian National University professor Dr Alwen Tiu told Guardian Australia that he had discovered “a different bug, unrelated to [the previous vulnerability] that has the same effect of extracting a permanent, trackable identity from an Android device”. <br><br>He said that this issue has not yet been addressed despite him reporting it to the DTA on the 2 June along with suggested a fix.</blockquote><p>When you 'open source' your app but don't allow developers to publicly raise issues or submit pull requests directly in the repository, you destroy an important feedback loop and replace it with bureaucratic incompetence, i.e. layers of middle management that don't understand it but are required to sign off on even a single line of code:</p><blockquote>Jim Mussared, one of the developers who has been reporting flaws to the Digital Transformation Agency, expressed his dismay at how the DTA had been “not at all communicative” with developers about the issues. <br><br>“It takes them a long time to confirm the issues, many remain unfixed. Many of these issues have been one-line fixes. Additionally there’s been a complete lack of transparency around all aspects of the development of the app,” he said.</blockquote><p>Contact tracing apps need to be open source (ticks the trust box) and decentralised (ticks the privacy/security box) for enough people to want to use them. Centralised contact tracing apps Do. Not. Work because the technology can't function in Apple's walled garden, they are not interoperable with cross-border apps, and they create a giant honey pot that malicious states, individuals or even one's own government will spend an eternity trying to access.</p><p>At least the United Kingdom acknowledged that fact and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53095336">abandoned</a> its centralised contact tracing app before it was launched:</p><blockquote>In a major U-turn, the UK is ditching the way its current coronavirus-tracing app works and shifting to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google. <br><br>One advantage of the switch - if deployed - is that the NHS Covid-19 app would be able to overcome a limitation of iPhones and carry out Bluetooth "handshakes" when the software is running in the background. <br><br>Another is that it should be easier to make the app compatible with other countries' counterparts, which are based on the same system - including the Republic of Ireland and Germany.</blockquote><p>Curiously, the UK and Norway were both advised to adopt a centralised framework by Oxford University's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53051783">Big Data Institute</a>. The consultancy pushed for a centralised model because, like most epidemiological modellers, it failed to consider that humans were involved in the process and many wouldn't want to install an app that potentially violates their privacy, even if it's the first-best from an epidemiological data mining point of view.</p><p>But when decisions are made for politics rather than profit, what works is a secondary consideration. You see, UK politicians <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/19/1004190/uk-covid-contact-tracing-app-fiasco/">wanted glory</a>:</p><blockquote>They believed it [a centralised app] could gather the information it had collected on contacts into a protected data store, with the potential to be de-anonymized so people could be alerted if they had come in contact with someone who presented coronavirus symptoms or had received a positive test result. <br><br>The centralized approach would allow much more data analysis than decentralized models, which give users exposure notifications but don’t allow officials nearly so much access to data. <br>... <br>Ministers were focused on rolling out a “world-beating” app, rather than just a successful one, so that they could claim victory on the world stage. The momentum toward a centralized system became unstoppable—and the challenges of building one were largely brushed aside.</blockquote><p>It's not the first Big Data modelling stuff-up during this pandemic, either. The International Institute of Forecasters (IIF) has compiled a <a href="https://forecasters.org/blog/2020/06/14/forecasting-for-covid-19-has-failed/">long summary</a> of where it all went wrong, including poor data input, incorrect modelling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, failure to incorporate epidemiological features (e.g. humans), assuming benefits of available interventions without evidence, a lack of transparency, lack of modelling expertise, group-think and bandwagon effects, selective reporting and looking at only one or a few dimensions of the problem at hand.</p><p>Here's a chart provided by the IIF showing predictions for the number of US deaths during week 27 (for ~3 weeks downstream). The eight models displayed ranged from 2419 to 11190 deaths - a 4.5-fold difference - and the spectrum of 95% confidence intervals ranged from fewer than 100 deaths to over 16,000 deaths, almost a 200-fold difference. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/06/Ioannidis-figure2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://econbyte.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Ioannidis-figure2.png 600w, https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/06/Ioannidis-figure2.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The lesson is clear: models are useful as a <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/forecasting-lessons/">sensibility check</a> but should under no circumstance be relied upon to inform policy decisions, especially those as drastic as shutting down entire economies.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one in the United States appears to be happy with social media lately, other than the millions of people voluntarily using them every day. Both sides of politics are gearing up to pass or remove laws which will effectively <em>require</em> speech to be censored on social media platforms, albeit in slightly different ways. That differs from the current situation where speech <em>may</em> be censored, but doesn't have to be. It's why Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-respond-criticism-trump-facebook-2020-6">can be</a> "deeply shaken and disgusted by President Trump’s divisive and incendiary rhetoric", but still allow the post to remain, while Twitter opted to put it behind a content warning. It's called competition and people will vote with their eyeballs as to which content moderation model they prefer.</p><p>However, when you're a legislator everything must be solved with... legislation. We wrote the <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/platform-or-publisher-redux/">other week</a> about Trump's dislike for Section 230 - despite the fact it's the only thing that has prevented him from being banned entirely - and now it seems his administration is <a href="https://www.axios.com/white-house-taps-hawley-to-take-aim-at-230-facfc584-ec1a-45b2-af4d-f7ff6d853104.html">concocting some legislation</a> to act on that:</p><blockquote>The legislation would open platforms to legal liability if they enforce their terms of services in unequal or uneven ways, including by making politically motivated moderation decisions. <br><br>That would be a reversal from the broad immunity from lawsuits over both user-posted content and making moderation calls like taking down posts and banning user accounts that platforms have under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.</blockquote><p>Our old mate, US Attorney General William Barr, had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-trump-fcc/republican-senators-push-fcc-to-act-on-trump-social-media-order-idUSKBN23G2WP">this to say</a>:</p><blockquote>These entities are now engaged in censorship. We are looking, as many others are, at changing Section 230.</blockquote><p>Yes, it's censorship. <strong>Platforms are allowed to censor the content on their platforms</strong>. If you don't like it, feel free to start your own. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites">Many have tried</a>, many have failed, because people are quite happy with the 'almost free speech' models of Facebook and Twitter. There is no issue here that needs to be regulated.</p><p>Alas, it seems that the Democrats are also unhappy with social media. Not to be outdone by Trump, the Biden campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/technology/biden-facebook-misinformation.html">is gearing up</a> for its own assault:</p><blockquote>"I’ve never been a big Zuckerberg fan," Mr. Biden said. "I think he’s a real problem." <br><br>Mr. Biden also called for the end of the legal shield Mr. Trump targeted recently in his executive order. The vice president said Facebook’s inaction demonstrated the need to revoke the law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields them from most liability for the content they host.</blockquote><p>A reminder that Section 230 is what protects media platforms from being held liable for their users' content. In other words, Facebook cannot be sued for Trump or Biden's content, regardless of how misleading of malicious it may be. Once again, this isn't a free speech issue: no one is forcing them to use these platforms, nor do the platforms have to provide them with a voice.</p><p>Removing Section 230 would <strong>require </strong>platforms to engage in an enormous amount of content editing (censorship), the same way a newspaper has to control what appears on its pages. But newspapers don't have to deal with the volume of content that social media platforms encounter. Removing Section 230 would effectively destroy the existing social media business model overnight.</p><p>However, there is some good news. Big Tech <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/10/amazon-facebook-google-political-allies-antitrust/">donates a lot</a> to political campaigns, and any change to Section 230 would require Congress' support:</p><blockquote>With legal action imminent — and President Trump recently taking fresh, aggressive aim at Silicon Valley — the industry’s largest companies have shelled out sizable sums to lobby in Washington. Amazon, Facebook and Google have spent more than $11 million combined over the first three months of 2020 to influence federal action on a range of issues, including antitrust, according to ethics disclosures filed with Congress. The amount is slightly higher than the same period in 2019. <br><br>But those figures do not reflect the hard-to-track sums spent by the industry to shape public opinion beyond the Beltway. Many in the tech industry privately say they’ve adopted such tactics because they face an onslaught of criticism from a wide array of new opposition groups, such as the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit that has produced research critical of tech companies including Amazon and Google.</blockquote><p>Section 230 won't disappear because it'll never get through Congress. But the threat alone may be enough to force Big Tech into a "compromise", e.g. establishing an "independent" censorship body of some kind to set rules about content. I have no problem with that if it's voluntary, but as soon as it becomes law it would serve as a costly barrier to new entrants, granting Zuckerberg the oligarch status he <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0f2c8952-a719-11ea-92e2-cbd9b7e28ee6">so desires</a>.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

Both the states and the DOJ are looking to file a suit against the internet giant as soon as within the next few months, the people told CNBC. <br><br>The states and the Justice Department have not yet officially decided whether to combine their expected suits, the people said, though they have been collaborating closely. Both have been investigating Google’s search, ad technology and android business. <br><br>The attorneys general investigating Google, which is owned by Alphabet, haven’t yet definitively ruled out pushing for alternatives for its ad technology business, like imposing restrictions on how it runs its business, one of the sources said. A suit may also include a push for both that option and breaking up the ad tech business.</blockquote><p>Let me be perfectly clear: if this goes ahead, it would almost certainly be bad for consumers. Google might dominate digital advertising <em>right now</em>, but that doesn't mean there's a monopoly or antitrust issue. The market is highly contestable and Google dominates the space only because it's better than the alternatives. That's bad for Google's competitors, whether it's in advertising, search or mobile, precisely because it's good for consumers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/06/temporary-monopolies.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1105826226080497665">Source</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a reason why most of the big, successful tech companies come out of the United States and not Europe.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Western Australia Day. What a week for social media, and not in a good way. Let's recap:</p><ul><li>26 May: Twitter added a fact-check link below two of Donald Trump's <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255835124539392">tweets</a> about mail-in voting.</li><li>27 May: Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265427538140188676">tweets</a> that Twitter "is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!... We will <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456">strongly regulate</a>, or close them down".</li><li>28 May: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave an interview to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-twitter-fact-checking-trump">Fox News</a>, stating that "We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this... I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that."</li><li>28 May: Donald Trump signed the "<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/">Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship</a>", taking aim at Section 230 of the "Communications Decency Act", which essentially says companies can't be held liable for the things their users put on their platforms.</li><li>29 May: Twitter censors one of Donald Trump's <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704">tweets</a> about George Floyd, alleging it "glorifies violence". Trump responds by tweeting "Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated!".</li></ul><p>I wrote about social media as a platform vs. publisher <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/platform-or-publisher/">over a year ago</a>. My view was that Twitter was gradually shifting away from being a pure platform by engaging in actions more akin to that of a publisher ('content provider'), weakening its protections under S230 and opening itself up to litigation.</p><p>It seems that has now happened (sort of), although in terms of Trump's executive order, Twitter should be fine. Twitter's liable for the fact-check - which is its own content - but nothing more. This isn't a First Amendment issue and Trump has no rights to force a private company to display his messages, or to give him an account in the first place. The only reason he hasn't been banned already is probably due to his status and that he's quite lucrative in terms of advertising (until he erodes S230 and Twitter becomes liable for his tweets).</p><p>But by pissing Trump off, Twitter has put itself at risk of <em>future</em> laws. Just because it’s protected under S230 right now doesn’t mean a politician won’t come along and regulate those protections away in the future (antitrust, anyone?).</p><p>Already Senator Ted Cruz, in a <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-cruz-calls-for-criminal-investigation-of-twitter-3bec3098-3fbf-45b2-a5bf-cbda7cace940.html">letter sent last Friday</a> to the Justice and Treasury departments, has laid the groundwork by calling for "a criminal investigation of Twitter over allegations the company is violating U.S. sanctions against Iran". When in doubt, use the national security card / blame Iran, a favourite strategy of Trump's:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/05/trump-iran-tweets.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Trump says (and signs) lots of things he doesn't believe. There's no doubt his feud with Twitter is nothing more than a distraction from the coronavirus pandemic and the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. But that doesn't mean he won't follow through with his threats.</p><p>Interestingly, the rest of the major social media players have either remained silent or pushed back against Twitter. Facebook's vice president of global policy management, Monika Bickert, had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21275044/facebook-trump-tweets-employee-reaction-criticism">this</a> to say:</p><blockquote>We do not believe that a private technology company like Facebook should be in the business of vetting what politicians say in the context of a political debate. As is the case with the President’s tweets, speech from candidates and elected officials is highly scrutinized and debated. We think people should be allowed to hear what politicians say, make up their own minds and hold politicians to account.</blockquote><p>That sounds almost as though Facebook believes a body of persons entitled to vote in an election should hold politicians accountable for their speech. Fair enough, although I should note Facebook is rolling out its own "Oversight Board", which will <a href="https://twitter.com/oversightboard/status/1266736657509875718">soon begin</a> making "decisions on what content Facebook &amp; Instagram should allow or remove, based on respect for freedom of expression &amp; human rights". Sounds very dystopian, and I worry that it won't be long before the White House has its very own "Department of Social Media Oversight".</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p style="text-align:center">---</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The good news is an alternative already exists. It's called the 'Fediverse', and it's a fully decentralised, distributed, interoperable group of servers, each with their own rules. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Wikipedia</a> entry:</p><blockquote>The software spanning the fediverse are all free. Some of them vaguely resemble Twitter in style (for example, Mastodon, Misskey, GNU social, and Pleroma, which are similar in their microblogging function), while others include more communication and transaction options that are instead comparable to Google+ or Facebook (such as is the case with Friendica and Hubzilla).</blockquote><p>The services mentioned above all use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> protocol, which was recently made a recommended standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main international standards organisation for the web. In laymen's terms, ActivityPub allows anyone to operate/select their own server with its own content rules, but still follow anyone on any other server.</p><p>To simplify further, the fediverse is like email but for social media, with the currently dominant Twitter/Facebook model more akin to email if you could only contact other people using the same provider (e.g. if GMail accounts could only email other GMail accounts).</p><p>I haven't been following the fediverse space that closely but decided to dive in again following Trump's S230 order (back-story: I operated a now-defunct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump.io">pump.io</a> node on the fediverse several years ago).</p><p>A little research revealed that Mastodon is by far the most popular service on the fediverse, although it's quite resource-intensive from a sysadmin point of view. Being the cheapskate I am, I discovered Pleroma, a relatively new option (first stable release ~Feb 2019) that can run on as little as a <a href="https://blog.soykaf.com/post/what-is-pleroma/">Raspberry Pi</a>.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Masayoshi Son's Vision Fund released its <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2019/earnings-presentation_q4fy2019_01_en.pdf">earnings results</a> last week, which contained a few odd graphics on horses and unicorns, such as this one:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/05/vision-fund-unicorns-virus.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Son wants us to believe that despite some of his investments falling into the 'valley of coronavirus', some will grow wings and emerge as unicorns. In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-05-18/the-unicorns-fell-into-a-ditch">own words</a>:</p><blockquote>The situation is exceedingly difficult. Our unicorns have fallen into this sudden coronavirus ravine. But some of them will use this crisis to grow wings.</blockquote><p>Exceedingly difficult is an understatement. The Vision Fund business lost 1.9 trillion yen ($US17.7 billion) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-18/wework-s-valuation-has-dropped-to-2-9-billion-softbank-says?sref=1kJVNqnU">last fiscal year</a>:</p><blockquote>The valuation of WeWork has tumbled to $2.9 billion amid the coronavirus pandemic and its ongoing business struggles, a tiny fraction of its peak when the office-sharing company was among the world’s leading startups. <br><br>WeWork’s latest valuation was disclosed as SoftBank Group Corp., its largest shareholder, reported earnings on Monday. WeWork had been valued at $7.8 billion at the end of September after the Japanese company agreed to a bailout. Even that was far from its once-lofty $47 billion valuation.</blockquote><p>It's not just WeWork, either. The Vision Fund had to write down the valuations of most of its investments, including Uber and other startups weighted heavily toward the sharing economy. Son loved to invest in companies that pay people to use their products in the hopes of one day achieving a monopoly and higher prices. And he paid for that gamble <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2019/11/25/softbanks-highly-leveraged-vision-funda-house-of-cards/">with debt</a>:</p><blockquote>...the capital structure of the Vision Fund makes the fund itself some-what of a perilous operating entity. Outside investors committed money into the fund in the form of 62% debt and 38% equity. SoftBank contributed roughly $33 billion solely in the form of equity, which is 50% of the aggregate equity in the fund. For the fund, the contributions resulted in an aggregate capital structure of 40% debt and 60% equity. Approximately $40 billion in debt contribution is in the form of preferred units with 7% coupon rate over the 12-year life of the fund. While the attractive coupon payout may have helped raise large chunks of money quickly, it also may have substantially increased the fund's operating risk.</blockquote><p>There's a reasonable chance that the Vision Fund will be wiped out well before any unicorns can emerge from the coronavirus ravine. Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors in Singapore, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-05-21/softbank-s-masa-misra-partnership-strained-by-losses-infighting">summed up</a> the Vision Fund appropriately by calling its management "a bunch of dealmakers obsessed with leverage who have no business running a venture capital fund".</p><p>Debt is an amplifier in good and bad times. You can look like a genius when the tide is lifting all boats, and it was only last May SoftBank Group (which owns the Vision Fund) reported its highest ever operating profit thanks to the Vision Fund's investments. But when the tide recedes and the bad times roll in, debt makes things so, so much worse, with SoftBank's overall net loss to reach 900 billion yen this year. The problem is even the Vision Fund's profits from last year were illusory - 'paper' - based entirely on rising valuations for loss-making companies that it continuously funnelled cash into, further propping up their valuations... you get the idea.</p><p>Had the Vision Fund used more equity instead of debt, it would have had a natural shock absorber and could have ridden out the coronavirus. But it has debts to pay (at a coupon rate of 7%!), meaning it's going to have to sell assets (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-sell-41-billion-in-assets-plans-big-share-buyback-11584944934">$US41 billion so far</a>) - including future unicorns - just to stay alive.</p><p>Son may be right about horses emerging from the valley of the coronavirus as unicorns, but they'll probably be owned by someone else.</p><h2 id="other-bits-of-interest">Other bits of interest</h2><h3 id="apple-and-google-s-framework-is-ready">Apple and Google's framework is ready</h3><blockquote>...this launch means that developers working on behalf of public health agencies can now issue apps that make use of it — Apple and Google themselves are not creating an exposure-notification or contact-tracing app. <br><br>The exposure notification API works using a decentralized identifier system that uses randomly generated temporary keys created on a user’s device (but not tied to their specific identify or info). Apple and Google’s API allows public health agencies to define what constitutes potential exposure in terms of exposed time and distance, and they can tweak transmission risk and other factors according to their own standards. <br><br>Further, Apple and Google will allow apps to make use of a combination of the API and voluntarily submitted user data that they provide through individual apps to enable public health authorities to contact exposed users directly to make them aware of what steps they should take.</blockquote><p>I'm no fan of Apple or Google and Big Tech's general love of spying on people. But this framework is the only way we'll ever have a privacy-friendly, functional, cross-country compatible contact tracing app. I hope that countries currently using a centralised version consider rebuilding their apps - 'version 2.0!' - using this framework.</p><ul><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/apple-and-google-launch-exposure-notification-api-enabling-public-health-authorities-to-release-apps/">Apple and Google launch exposure notification API, enabling public health authorities to release apps</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200520/10571644539/case-contact-tracing-apps-built-apple-googles-exposure-notification-system.shtml">The Case For Contact Tracing Apps Built On Apple And Google's Exposure Notification System</a></li><li><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90508044/north-dakotas-covid-19-app-has-been-sending-data-to-foursquare-and-google">North Dakota’s COVID-19 app has been sending data to Foursquare and Google</a></li><li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/18/the-technologies-the-world-is-using-to-track-coronavirus-and-people/">The technologies the world is using to track coronavirus — and people</a></li><li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/18/how-congress-is-shaping-data-privacy-laws-during-the-pandemic/">How Congress is shaping data privacy laws during the pandemic</a></li></ul><h3 id="the-cluster-based-coronavirus-approach">The cluster-based coronavirus approach</h3><blockquote>So what is the Japan model? First, it is a cluster-based approach, derived from a hypothesis obtained from an epidemiological study based on Chinese data and conducted on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that entered the port of Yokohama on February 3, 2020. <br><br>It posits that the explosive increase in infected persons is a result of the high transmissibility of certain infected individuals, which forms a cluster. Infected individuals with even higher transmissibility appear from these clusters to form more clusters and infect many others. Based on this hypothesis, under the cluster-based approach, each cluster is tracked to the original infection source and persons with high transmissibility are isolated to prevent the spread of infection.</blockquote><p>Key to the cluster-based approach is avoiding the "three C's":</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/05/japan-avoid-three-cs.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Lockdowns aren't required (well, maybe if you fail to initially respond in time, as happened in many countries), neither are strong-armed restrictions on day-to-day activity.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's coronavirus tracing app, COVIDSafe - which has also become the political buzzword of choice being dribbled <em>ad nauseam</em> in every.single.speech - passed three milestones this week:</p><ol><li>Nearly 6 million people have downloaded the app.</li><li>The COVIDSafe legislation cleared Parliament.</li><li>The app's source code was released.</li></ol><p>Sounds good, right? Certainly checks all of my boxes, given that around a month ago <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/australias-contact-tracing-app/">I wrote</a>:</p><blockquote>Don't rush into installing this app [COVIDSave] until the government can guarantee, through legislation and the source code, that it actually has people's best interests at heart.</blockquote><p>Alas, I suppose I should have been clearer. While the situation has no doubt improved since I wrote that, the Australian government unfortunately managed to half-arse everything. Given this late stage - you can't ask people to trust you twice - its poor decisions mean the COVIDSafe app will almost certainly find itself relegated to the role of safety theatre, as opposed to its <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app">stated goal</a> of "slowing the spread of COVID-19".</p><p>Now I'm going to tell you why.</p><p><strong>1. Nearly 6 million people have downloaded the app.</strong></p><p>There are about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetration">17 million</a> smartphone users in Australia, meaning that with 6 million downloads COVIDSafe is rapidly closing in on Prime Minister Scott Morrison's <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/readers-respond-to-the-covidsafe-app-s-launch-20200506-p54qf1.html">40% adoption target</a>. Unfortunately, total downloads is not the correct metric to use for gauging how many people are actually using a piece of software and the adoption rate may actually be significantly lower. </p><p>What the government should be reporting is <em>the number of active users</em>. That metric is commonly known as "DAU" (daily active users) or "MAU" (monthly active users) and it's the gold standard for the tech sector. Not providing those data is at best suspicious, at worst malicious.</p><p>Without knowing the number of active users, we have no idea how many Australians actually have a functional, up-to-date version of COVIDSafe installed on their phones. Many people could have installed it out of a sense of civic duty only to subsequently remove it for a variety of reasons, such as its <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/05/covidsafe-update-bug-fix-iphone-android/">failure to operate as specified</a>, its high battery usage, or privacy concerns.</p><p>Keeping the active user data a secret smells an awful lot like a political face-saving exercise designed to avoid the embarrassment of its own poor decision-making process.</p><p><strong>2. The COVIDSafe legislation cleared Parliament.</strong></p><p>Of the three milestones, this gets the only passing grade. The COVIDSafe <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6556">legislation</a> was approved by Parliament this week and contains a lot of important protections, including criminal offences for those caught misusing the COVIDSafe app and the data it collects.</p><p>However, it places no firm time limit on the retention of the collected data. While there is a requirement for it to be deleted when the Health Minister deems it "is no longer required to prevent or control [COVID-19]; or is no longer likely to be effective in preventing or controlling [COVID-19]", there is no explicit sunset clause, meaning the government can hold onto it for a long, long time.</p><p>As the saying goes, nothing is so permanent as a temporary government programme. The legislation does nothing to allay that concern.</p><p><strong>3. The app's source code was released.</strong></p><p>The Australian government finally released the <a href="https://github.com/AU-COVIDSafe">source code</a> for the COVIDSafe app.</p><p>Well, some of it.</p><p>For whatever reason, the government again decided to go against best practices and keep the server code closed, meaning we have no idea how stored data are encrypted. Contrast that with the Singaporean government (it provided the framework from which the COVIDSafe app was built), which released the source for both its app <em>and</em><strong> </strong>server code. Even the UK's National Health Service (NHS) - also developing a centralised tracing app - released the source code for both its client and server components.</p><p>Sadly, it gets worse.</p><p>The government also scrubbed the history of changes made to the code (important for auditing), disabled pull requests (this is how the community can suggest improvements to open source products) and has just generally been hostile to developers wanting to help. According to open source software engineer <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/covidsafe-code-released-but-developers-unhappy/">Geoffrey Huntley</a>:</p><blockquote>The Australian tech industry really wants to help make it better, but their actions are absolutely hostile. We want to follow what the NHS did, which is build a healthy community that wants to help out. We have a community of software engineers and experts but they are inhibited from looking at the source code because of the licencing problem. They released the source code but did it in the most political, check-box way and scrubbed all of the history and all of the metadata. There's no way to know when a bug was fixed and it's very hard to track at all. They have deleted all of the audit trail and disabled the ability for one to ever happen.</blockquote><p>My suspicion is that much like how airport screening is mostly <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2009/11/beyond_security_thea.html">security theatre</a>, Australia's COVIDSafe app will end up as nothing more than safety theatre. Under the safety theatre model, the government will be able to proudly proclaim its world-leading status with a functional, widely <em>downloaded</em> contact tracing app, without actually proving that it has provided any public health benefits (or will in the future).</p><p>While the best option at this late stage would be to throw the code out and roll with the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/05/washington_post_exposure_notification_story">superior</a> Apple/Google decentralised framework (which could even be made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/how-will-europes-coronavirus-contacts-tracing-apps-work-across-borders/">cross-country compatible</a> to support travellers, unlike COVIDSafe and other centralised solutions), governments rarely treat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">sunk costs</a> as sunk.</p><p>Sadly, I have no doubt that when given the choice by his mandarins Scott Morrison will elect to double down on the dud that is COVIDSafe, given that the alternative involves admitting his government was wrong (essentially kryptonite to a politician).</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regular readers should be well aware of the privacy and security revelations that plagued videoconferencing platform Zoom last month. It was <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/zoom-is-proof-people-dont-care/">a long list</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/05/zoom-issues.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>What wasn't clear was whether or not Zoom would be able to recover from the public relations disaster. Throughout its 9-year existence it prioritised features and flexibility at any cost, including its users' privacy and security. As I wrote in <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/zoom-is-proof-people-dont-care/">Issue 72</a>,</p><blockquote>...one of the lasting post-coronavirus impacts is likely to be remote work, with Zoom well placed to capture at least some of that market (Microsoft - which acquired the market leader Skype back in 2011 - really dropped the ball here). There are enough people that don't care about privacy or security - hello Facebook - for Zoom to still do quite well in the post-coronavirus world. Its next move will be its most important.</blockquote><p>Well Zoom has now made its next move, and it's a good one in terms of improving security: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/zoom-buys-keybase-in-first-deal-as-part-of-plan-to-fix-security.html">it acquired Keybase</a>, a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging and file-sharing service that, up until I heard the news, I used and encouraged others to use. It is essentially the polar opposite of Zoom, in that the security of its users' data were always put first.</p><p>The acquisition of Keybase will give Zoom 25 top-notch security and cryptography experts that should be able to plug the gaping holes that were revealed last month. It's a sign that Zoom is serious about making its service <em>at least</em> as secure as any of the other mainstream competitors, i.e. secure enough for the vast majority of users.</p><p>Unfortunately, the acquisition likely spells the end for Keybase. There was always an element of trust involved as it never open sourced its server code (probably in the hopes of eventually monetising the service), and joining Zoom has destroyed that trust. While Zoom has now moved up a bracket and I would use it for day-to-day collaboration if an organisation for which I worked was paying (end-to-end encryption will only be available on<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/05/07/zoom-acquires-keybase-and-announces-goal-of-developing-the-most-broadly-used-enterprise-end-to-end-encryption-offering/"> paid accounts</a>), Keybase - given its purpose - will now effectively become vapourware.</p><p>If anyone is looking for Keybase alternatives, your best bet is to use some combination of <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a>/<a href="https://about.riot.im/">Riot.im</a> for chat and any mainstream cloud provider with <a href="https://cryptomator.org">Cryptomator</a><a href="https://meet.jit.si/"><a href="https://jitsi.org/blog/e2ee/">.</a></a> I haven't tried it yet, but <a href="https://keys.pub/">keys.pub</a> looks promising as a signing and validation service.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eleven years ago programmers at Google thought they had solved a long-running problem: early detection of disease activity. As they wrote in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07634">2009 <em>Nature</em> journal article</a>, such an innovation could save millions of lives:</p><blockquote>In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza.</blockquote><p>The ability to rapidly trace COVID-19 outbreaks may have helped many countries avoid costly lockdowns. Here's how Google tackled the problem:</p><blockquote>Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users.</blockquote><p>Google's method involved using a black box containing four years' worth of data with 50 million search queries feeding 450 million different models to test queries across a distributed computing framework with hundreds of machines. Sounds impressive, right? The problem was, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/can-learn-epic-failure-google-flu-trends/">it didn't work</a>:</p><blockquote>GFT failed—and failed spectacularly—missing at the peak of the 2013 flu season by 140 percent. When Google quietly euthanized the program, called Google Flu Trends (GFT), it turned the poster child of big data into the poster child of the foibles of big data. <br>...<br>For example, Google’s algorithm was quite vulnerable to overfitting to seasonal terms unrelated to the flu, like “high school basketball.” With millions of search terms being fit to the CDC’s data, there were bound to be searches that were strongly correlated by pure chance, and these terms were unlikely to be driven by actual flu cases or predictive of future trends. Google also did not take into account changes in search behavior over time. After the introduction of GFT, Google introduced its suggested search feature as well as a number of new health-based add-ons to help people more effectively find the information they need. While this is great for those using Google, it also makes some search terms more prevalent, throwing off GFT’s tracking.</blockquote><p>The lesson? For forecasting, simplicity is often better:</p><blockquote>Our team from Northeastern University, the University of Houston, and Harvard University compared the performance of GFT with very simple models based on the CDC’s data, finding that GFT had begun to perform worse. Moreover, we highlighted a persistent pattern of GFT performing well for two to three years and then failing significantly and requiring substantial revision.</blockquote><p>All Big Data, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) systems suffer from the same flaws, in that they can only draw inferences from past events. That would be all well and good if we lived in a mostly static, unchanging world. But we don't, as a more recent Google AI medical experiment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/google-medical-researchers-humbled-when-ai-screening-tool-falls-short-in-real-life-testing/">discovered</a>:</p><blockquote>When introducing new technologies, planners, policy makers, and technology designers did not account for the dynamic and emergent nature of issues arising in complex healthcare programs. The authors argue that attending to people—their motivations, values, professional identities, and the current norms and routines that shape their work—is vital when planning deployments.</blockquote><p>We live in a world with <strong>people</strong>, not robots. Dynamic, independent people. Occasionally one of them might think it's a good idea to chow down on a bat sandwich.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/05/machine_learning-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>It seems that at least in the private sector, forecasters are starting to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238229/algorithms-supply-chain-model-pandemic-disruption-amazon-walmart">acknowledge that fact</a>:</p><blockquote>Most retail companies rely on some type of model or algorithm to help predict what their customers will want, whether it be a simple Excel spreadsheet or a refined, engineer-built program. Normally, those models are fairly reliable and work well. But just like everything else, they’re affected by the pandemic. <br><br>“When you have something like COVID-19, it’s just a total outlier,” says Joel Beal, the co-founder of the consumer goods analytics company Alloy. “No model can predict that.” <br><br>Because of the massive, worldwide disruptions, the normal data feeding the models — which include buying patterns over years — aren’t as relevant. <br><br>“You’re probably going to not use as much historical data or will not be weighing that as much as you expected,” Beal says. Instead, companies are likely using much more recent data: looking to last week to predict next week, for example, or just relying on the few months of information on what was purchased since the pandemic took off worldwide.</blockquote><p>For now, judgement has replaced black box models as the most important component in decision making. According to Beal:</p><blockquote>“Companies have to rely more on good demand planners and forecasting people, who will say, ‘do I believe this?’ Rather than believing these models will be able to capture everything that’s going on.”</blockquote><p>My personal view is that models are useful as a sensibility check. If you expect X to be Y at a certain date, a model can tell you whether or not that is reasonable by running a regression against historical data. Does adding judgement bias the forecast? Sure. But unlike models, that bias can be defended, and it has the benefit of building in the transparency and flexibility that many so-called sophisticated models sorely lack.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

We're now at the start of May, meaning Sweden would need to record another 49,000 COVID-19 deaths in the next two months just to reach the lower bound of this study's 95% confidence interval.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia finally released its COVID-19 contact tracing app on Sunday, dubbed "<a href="https://www.covidsafe.gov.au/help-topics.html">COVIDSafe</a>". The good news is that it's based on the protocol open sourced by the Singaporean government, <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/australias-covid-tracing-app-better-than-singapores-health-chief-547126">BlueTrace</a>:</p><blockquote>Like TraceTogether, Australia’s tracing app will use Bluetooth to identify when two people with the app installed come within one-and-a-half metres of one another for 15 minutes or more. <br><br>It will do this by exchanging encrypted unique identifiers that will be stored on an individual’s device for a rolling period of 21 days. <br><br>These IDs would then only become available to state and territory health professionals if a person tested positive to COVID-19 and consented to the release of the data.</blockquote><p>The bad news is that Australia's modified version is closed source, the promised privacy-enshrining <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/new-laws-to-cover-coronavirus-app-after-fears-police-could-access-data-20200423-p54mmr.html">legislation</a> is non-existent, and its centralised database is stored on the Amazon Web Services platform, meaning a certain country could, in theory, seize it at any time. Being centralised, it's also more vulnerable to malicious actors (hackers and foreign governments).</p><p>In short, the bad outweighs the good and if you care about your privacy you shouldn't install it in its current form. For those still curious, this is how it's supposed to work:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/04/covid19safe.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>How we're told the contact tracing app works.</figcaption></figure><p>I don't doubt the government's ability to achieve what the infographic above lays out; Singapore already did the hard yards for them. But its approach to privacy is quite literally, "trust us, pretty please". This from a government that has <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/everyone-spies-on-everyone/">for the past few years</a> actively tried to undermine people's digital privacy.</p><p>Give me a break.</p><p>The government has stated it wants at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/australias-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-what-we-know-so-far">least a 40% uptake</a> for the app to work properly. Prime Minister Scott Morrison used a wartime comparison as part of his sales pitch:</p><blockquote>“In the war, people bought war bonds to get in behind the national effort. What we’re doing in fighting this fight is we’ll be asking people to download an app which helps us trace the virus quickly and the more people who do that, the more we can get back to a more liveable set of arrangements.”</blockquote><p>The problem is we're not at war any more. The stated goal - the war - was the lockdown to <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/a-lasting-impact-of-the-coronavirus/">flatten the curve</a>, so as to not overwhelm the health system. People responded relatively well, getting "behind the national effort", and that goal has been achieved. The war is over, and now we need to rebuild.</p><p>But Morrison doesn't seem to understand that, and is asking people to make another sacrifice - this time, their privacy. I <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/virus-tracking-and-the-privacy-trade-off/">get the need</a> for a contact tracing app as it will, on some margin, help to prevent a second wave of infections at a relatively low cost. But by keeping the source code closed and effectively asking Australians to blindly trust him and his government, Morrison is raising that cost to the point where it no longer passes a cost benefit test.</p><p>Law enforcement have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/23/government-rules-out-police-having-any-access-to-australian-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app">already asked for the data</a>, and without the proper safeguards (legislation) or an open source code, one can't help but feel that given Australia's track record - anti-encryption, metadata retention, raiding journalists to name just three - such a move is an inevitability once the crisis is over, if not before. Even if the app is safe for now (and coding sleuths <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewrdev/status/1254336105203200000">suggest it is</a>), Australia's destruction of privacy legislation over the past few years means the legal structure is conducive to changing the code on the fly without informing people. There's literally <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/australia-encryption-law-global-impact/">a law</a> allowing authorities to compel companies to backdoor their apps; by comparison, corrupting a government app would be a walk in the park.</p><p>This app is a big fail all around. Somehow the government managed to spend at least <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/australia-launches-covid-19-app-whatsapp-group-539974">$2.4 million</a> on what was already 99% built by Singapore.

Companies are being forced to raise their corporate metabolism and overcome “analysis paralysis”, an affliction caused by top managers having pored over the same irrelevant case studies at business school.

As the boss of a Fortune 500 firm recently put it, “We are learning more by testing than [from] months spent [with] analysts and endless meetings.” Despite a worldwide retail apocalypse, Nike saw global internet sales of its sporting goods rise by over a third in the three months to February, thanks to a deft digital pivot inspired by its early covid-19 experience in China. Revenues from its Chinese online offering grew by triple digits in January and February, year on year, as consumers shared workouts through WeChat and other social media.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has dubbed the downturn we're about to have the "<a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2020/04/14/the-great-lockdown-worst-economic-downturn-since-the-great-depression/">Great Lockdown</a>". I quite like it, as it recognises that it's a self-inflicted downturn. Had governments been better prepared, or responded in a timely manner, we wouldn't be here.</p><p>But that was then, this is now. I want to discuss a different but related phenomenon that is emerging from within the Great Lockdown: the Great Acceleration. A month or so ago I wrote about the <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/a-lasting-impact-of-the-coronavirus/">lasting effects of the coronavirus</a>, with one possibility being a shift to working from home. I don't expect it to become the norm post-crisis, but I do expect it to become more widely accepted. The shift was already happening - <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/coronavirus-remote-work-survey/">50% of Americans prefer working from home</a> - and the "Great Lockdown" simply accelerated the process.</p><p>That shift is just one small part of the (costly) Great Acceleration. Businesses and cultural norms that could have lingered for decades may not survive into the next quarter, let alone next year. Upmarket department store chains, gigantic cruise ships, debt-laden airlines, marginal restaurants, universities, cinemas, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-group-forecasts-7-bn-full-net-loss-111845217--finance.html">crazy billionaire Japanese Ponzi scheme investors</a> - none of them will return to how they were pre-crisis, or even return at all.</p><p>The Great Acceleration is Schumpeter's creative destruction on steroids. Essentially, business models which were already on the way out are being punished far more swiftly than would normally be the case. Rather than a slow transition over decades, it's all happening with one fell swoop (provided governments don't throw too much good money after bad propping up doomed businesses, creating a large wasteful 'zombie' economy).</p><p>On the other side of the ledger, ventures and technologies that were already on the way up are now so popular they're finding it difficult to keep up with the demand. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-17/shopify-surges-after-cto-touts-black-friday-level-traffic-k94d2z4r">Shopify</a> is now handling Black Friday level traffic every day, video conferencing service <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-15/houseparty-vies-with-zoom-to-be-homebound-chatters-app-of-choice">Houseparty</a> has seen 50 million sign-ups in the past month, and the share prices of Big Tech companies conducive to social distancing and working from home, such as Netflix and Amazon, have hit <a href="https://www.watoday.com.au/business/markets/pandemic-winners-amazon-netflix-shares-hit-record-high-20200417-p54kni.html">record highs</a>.</p><p>Now before anyone gets carried away let me be clear: the Great Acceleration is a costly, ill-advised phenomenon. It would be far better, both economically and socially, for the process to happen organically as it normally does. But it is what it is, and those who refuses to acknowledge the accelerated transformation of the global economy over the past couple of months will find it more difficult to adapt to the post-crisis world.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most governments (there are a few exceptions) failed to react to the coronavirus pandemic in time, effectively forcing them into more drastic measures at a later date, wreaking havoc on their economies. The politicians and epidemiologists were examining the case data but lags, exponential growth and poor testing regimes meant they were looking in the wrong place. The ensuing encroachment of government into our lives has been extremely violating for many, and will only be tolerated for so long.</p><p>Now we're at a point where many countries are close, or getting close, to the end of the lockdown phase. The coronavirus has been suppressed, which means a test, trace and isolate strategy will soon be rolled out. But how does a government trace the contacts of infected individuals without further invading their privacy? Somewhat surprisingly, Singapore - not known as a champion of civil liberties - came up with <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/26/singapore_tracetogether_coronavirus_encounter_tracing_app_lessons/">a solution</a>:</p><blockquote>The app, named TraceTogether, [makes it] easier to trace who else may have been exposed to the virus. With that info in hand, health authorities are better-informed about who needs to go into quarantine and can focus their resources on those who most need assistance. <br><br>The app is opt-in and doesn’t track users through space, instead recording who you have encountered. To do so, it requires Bluetooth and location services to be turned on when another phone running the app comes into range exchanges four nuggets of information - a timestamp, Bluetooth signal strength, the phone’s model, and a temporary identifier or device nickname. While location services are required, the app doesn't track users, instead helping to calculate distances between them.</blockquote><p>Singapore has <a href="https://github.com/opentrace-community">open sourced the app</a> so that other governments can create their own versions, and more importantly people can verify that they are, in fact, not spying on them (see <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-pandemic-is-a-trojan-horse-for-surveillance-programs-around-the-world-887fa6f12ec9">examples here</a> of countries that have not been so open).</p><p>Big Tech has become involved too, with rival giants Apple and Google <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/">teaming up</a> to "help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of the virus, with user privacy and security central to the design":</p><blockquote>First, in May, both companies will release APIs that enable interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities. These official apps will be available for users to download via their respective app stores. <br><br>Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work to enable a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms. This is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities. Privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance in this effort, and we look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders. We will openly publish information about our work for others to analyze.</blockquote><p>Bluetooth trace tracking is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/10/21215267/covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-bluetooth-coronavirus-flaws-public-health">not without its issues</a>, and neither is the <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1248707315626201088">Apple/Google contact tracing framework</a>, but if done properly is relatively costless and far better than the more intrusive alternatives, or no trace technology at all.</p><p>The fact is governments are going to be <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nhs-phone-app-holds-key-to-lifting-uks-coronavirus-lockdown-wfmt3pt0g">reluctant</a> to ease some of their more draconian measures unless they have something like a Bluetooth tracing app available, and it will be better for everyone if it's one with data security and privacy built in from the start (no Zoom developers, please).</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no perfect app that ticks all the boxes and the whole space remains a bit of a grey area. Too intrusive, and enough people won't use it for it to provide a reasonable gauge for infection contact tracing. Too private, and the data may not be sufficient or accurate enough.</p><p>In an ideal world, US Attorney General William Barr wouldn't have launched his <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/security-5/125569/messaging-app-signal-threatens-to-dump-us-market-if-anti-encryption-bill-passes">idiotic crusade against encryption</a>, as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-cryptography/">developments in that space</a> are the most promising in terms of the privacy/surveillance trade-off that we will face in the coming weeks. Perhaps if other countries such as Australia <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2018/australias-encryption-gamble/">hadn't tried so hard to ban encryption</a>, there might be some kind of private, encrypted Bluetooth tracing technology already available. But I digress.</p><p>I just hope that the politicians and their epidemiologists have had some time to <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/04/what-does-this-economist-think-of-epidemiology.html">learn a bit of economics</a> on the fly, understand that there are trade-offs, and more accurately estimate what are likely to be politically and socially sustainable options this time around. Look to Singapore, not <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/behind-global-efforts-make-privacy-first-coronavirus-tracking-app-n1177871">Israel and China</a>.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I'm writing about the videoconferencing software Zoom <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/zoom-there-goes-your-data/">again</a>. The thing is since I sent last week's issue, even more information has come to light about just how bad Zoom really is. It really, truly is pure malware, yet like its malware cousin Facebook, remains incredibly popular.</p><p>Regulators take note: there are enough people that don't sufficiently care about their data security to make the relatively costless switch to an alternative free videoconferencing provider, meaning they ascribe a value of close to zero on the information they reveal during a video call. People who care about privacy and security will use something else, those that don't will use Zoom. In that environment one-size-fits-all privacy regulation will do nothing but harm those who do not value it.</p><p>But back to Zoom. <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/zoom-there-goes-your-data/">Last week</a> I alluded to the fact that Zoom shouldn't be trusted because, from day one, it has prioritised just about everything else above its users' privacy and security. Companies with a culture that treats security as a patchwork whack-a-mole exercise rather than something that needs to be built into the core from the start are just asking for a major security breach.</p><p>Zoom is one of those companies. The list of issues revealed <strong>in the past week</strong> has been nothing short of astronomical for a company that had the gumption to claim on its website that it was "end-to-end encrypted" (it's not), so I'm going to list the articles here and you can read whatever tickles your fancy:</p><ul><li><a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">Zoom Meetings Aren’t End-to-End Encrypted, Despite Misleading Marketing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/aa-intergroup-meetings-zoom-bombing-trolls-alcoholics-anonymous-2020-3">Trolls are breaking into AA meetings held on Zoom video calls and harassing recovering alcoholics</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/zoombombing/">Beware of ‘ZoomBombing’: screensharing filth to video calls</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zoom-lets-attackers-steal-windows-credentials-run-programs-via-unc-links/">Zoom Lets Attackers Steal Windows Credentials, Run Programs via UNC Links</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/zoom-doom/">Ex-NSA hacker drops new zero-day doom for Zoom</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186152/zoom-transparency-report-access-now-advocacy-group">Advocacy group calls for Zoom to release a transparency report</a></li><li><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/war-dialing-tool-exposes-zooms-password-problems/">‘War Dialing’ Tool Exposes Zoom’s Password Problems</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204648/zoom-macos-installer-update-privacy-security-concerns">Zoom quickly fixes ‘malware-like’ macOS installer with new update</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/technology/zoom-linkedin-data.html">A Feature on Zoom Secretly Displayed Data From People’s LinkedIn Profiles</a></li><li><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/">Zoom has “rolled their own” encryption scheme, which has significant weaknesses</a></li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/03/thousands-zoom-video-calls-left-exposed-open-web/">Thousands of Zoom video calls left exposed on open Web</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-31/zoom-sued-for-allegedly-illegally-disclosing-personal-data">Zoom Sued for Allegedly Illegally Disclosing Personal Data</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e95m/zoom-leaking-email-addresses-photos">Zoom is Leaking Peoples' Email Addresses and Photos to Strangers</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing">‘Zoom is malware’: why experts worry about the video conferencing platform</a></li></ul><p>That's a lot discovered in a single week.

That's now being reflected in Zoom's share price, which has fallen nearly 20% in the past week although is still around double what it was pre-coronavirus.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/04/zoom-YahooFinanceChart.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>As I wrote <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/a-lasting-impact-of-the-coronavirus/">a few weeks ago</a>, one of the lasting post-coronavirus impacts is likely to be remote work, with Zoom well placed to capture at least some of that market (Microsoft - which acquired the market leader Skype back in 2011 - really <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition">dropped the ball</a> here).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have used Skype and email for work-related communication for a very long time, but they both lack comprehensive team coordination and collaboration features. That wasn't a big deal when you're sat sat within a few metres of the people with whom you want to collaborate. However, COVID-19 and the requisite social distancing has made that model all but impossible.</p><p>A huge percentage of the world's office workers are now locked up at home, and that has created demand for services that purport to offer said features. Enter the likes of Microsoft Teams (pre-installed with Windows), Slack, and Zoom, which have all surged in terms of user growth over the past few weeks.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/03/zoom-demand-surge.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Zoom is suddenly very popular. Source: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/03/13/zoom-video-coronavirus-eric-yuan-schools/">Forbes</a></figcaption></figure><p>But the large scale move to video conferencing and collaboration software has caused some to question just how private these services actually are. While Microsoft Teams and Slack are the more mature products and have at least put <em>some</em> thought into their privacy policies, Zoom has been rather <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account">reckless with its approach</a>:</p><p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Since we wrote this issue Zoom <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3b745/zoom-removes-code-that-sends-data-to-facebook">patched its iOS app</a>, and no longer sends data to Facebook upon opening. However, its blasé attitude to privacy and data security is still something to be very concerned about.]</p><blockquote>Upon downloading and opening the app, Zoom connects to Facebook's Graph API, according to Motherboard's analysis of the app's network activity. The Graph API is the main way developers get data in or out of Facebook. <br><br>The Zoom app notifies Facebook when the user opens the app, details on the user's device such as the model, the time zone and city they are connecting from, which phone carrier they are using, and a unique advertiser identifier created by the user's device which companies can use to target a user with advertisements. <br><br>Zoom is not forthcoming with the data collection or the transfer of it to Facebook. Zoom's policy says the company may collect user's "Facebook profile information (when you use Facebook to log-in to our Products or to create an account for our Products)," but doesn't explicitly mention anything about sending data to Facebook on Zoom users who don't have a Facebook account at all.</blockquote><p>Zoom is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">malware</a>, as it's "intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network". And it has been like that <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/zoom-privacy-issues/">for some time</a>:</p><blockquote>Last year, security consultant Johnathan Leitschuch discovered that Zoom set up a local web server on a user’s Mac device that allowed Zoom to bypass security features in Safari 12. <br><br>This led Electronic Privacy Information Center to file an FTC complaint against Zoom, alleging that Zoom “intentionally designed its web conferencing service to bypass browser security settings and remotely enable a user’s web camera without the knowledge or consent of the user.”<br><br>While Zoom has since removed these remote web servers, its cavalier approach to getting user permission and its disregard for security and privacy concerns in the pursuit of convenience raise serious questions about trust.</blockquote><p>As the article notes, Zoom has decided that control, convenience and operability should always come before privacy and security. Fair enough, too - that probably matches the choice set of most of its users.</p><p>The good news is that there are alternatives, including the fully encrypted and open source <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi Meet</a>. The bad news is that you've got a snowball's chance in hell of convincing your IT team it's a good idea to sacrifice a bit of centralised control to better protect their employees' privacy.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of the world has, to varying degrees, shut down. That means there's very little happening in the tech sector, outside of SoftBank's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/softbank-seeks-10-billion-to-supplement-vision-fund-amid-crisis">desperate attempt</a> to raise another $US10 billion (the definition of throwing good money after bad), or the US senate's determination to quickly pass through laws that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/senate-short-term-extension-spy-programs-132401">undermine</a> people's privacy.</p><p>So this week I'm going to write about the coronavirus again.</p><p>You may have heard the story of the Northern Italian town of Vò, about 65km west of Venice and sandwiched in the middle of Italy's coronavirus 'redzone'. If not, great, because I'm about to tell you.</p><p>Vò had some of Italy's earliest coronavirus cases and was the first city to experience a COVID-19 death, leading Italian researchers to test the entire town - around 3,300 people - for COVID-19. What did they find? That nearly 3% of the population were infected, many of them without symptoms. So they quarantined the <a href="https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-21/one-italian-town-is-bucking-the-countrys-coronavirus-curve/12075048">entire town</a> as a precaution:</p><blockquote>"They were asked not to go out, and not to have contact with any other people," Professor Crisanti said.  The researchers decided against sending patients to hospital to prevent them spreading the disease there. "In principle many people in the hospital were infected. Many doctors, many nurses, many patients. This could be a major source of infection," he said. <br><br>After two weeks of quarantine, the researchers carried out another round of mass testing in Vo. The rate of COVID-19 infection had dropped from nearly 3 per cent to 0.41 per cent. Luca Zaia, the governor of Veneto, has now declared the town of Vo the "healthiest place in Italy".</blockquote><p>Professor Crisanti has one regret:</p><blockquote>"As soon as we made data available that the infection rate in Vo was 3 per cent, they should have rung the alarm bell," he says. "If at that time we had locked down all the cities with cases and carried out extensive testing, we would not be in this situation."</blockquote><p>I'd say he has a good point - by the time this issue has been distributed, Italy will have recorded its 5,000th COVID-19 related death from well over 50,000 reported cases. The country is now in a full blown health and economic crisis.</p><p>There are some important lessons we can take away from the experience in Vò.</p><p><strong>1. Think exponentially, not linearly</strong></p><p>No politician wants to act prematurely and risk being accused of overreacting. They would much rather wait until the situation worsens, declare themselves a "<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/analysis-seven-days-as-a-wartime-president-trumps-up-and-down-command-of-a-pandemic/ar-BB11ubqQ">wartime President</a>", and re-frame the narrative to paint themselves as the hero when things eventually get better (and they will, provided governments don't cause too much damage in the meantime - please, no price controls!). </p><p>Bureaucrats face similar incentives. It would be a career limiting move to risk prematurely raising the alarm, especially if senior politicians are still telling people to "<a href="https://www.3aw.com.au/scott-morrisons-message-to-fearful-australians-who-are-panic-buying/">just get about their daily business</a>". No one who knows how to get themselves promoted in a bureaucratic organisation - and especially not someone in human resources - will risk challenging the prevailing rules and advice unless it first comes from the top-down (i.e. a politician), which means by the time appropriate action is taken, it's already too late.</p><p>Unfortunately, those incentives lead to precisely the opposite behaviour to what is required to stem a viral outbreak, because viruses spread exponentially, not linearly. That leads people to underestimate the risks in the early phase when case numbers are low and <em>appear</em> to be growing linearly, and overestimate the risks in the latter phase (epidemics generally follow a bell curve pattern - the red line below).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/03/how-viruses-spread-small.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p><strong>2. Early social distancing is key, even before you think you need to</strong></p><p>When I say early, I mean early. Exponential growth and the inevitable lags before a case is confirmed - the average case shows symptoms only after <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/">about 5 days</a>, and people may not report for testing until much later than that (if at all) - means if you only watch the case data you will always be at least a week behind reality.</p><p>Let's put that into context. If the confirmed case data are a week behind, you have 1,000 cases, and cases are growing at least 20% per day (basically Australia at the time of writing), that means you probably already have around 3,500 cases. But by the time the 3,500th case is confirmed, you're actually at about 13,000 cases. And so on.</p><p>See the problem for policy-makers looking solely at the number of confirmed cases? Everything they do, when they eventually get around to doing it, will be at least a week too late.</p><p>What should be done instead is as soon as community transmission is confirmed - even just a handful of cases - the first, relatively low-cost social distancing measures should be implemented. Given the exponential nature of viruses, even a small reduction in the rate of infections can dramatically slow the spread.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/03/social-distancing-small.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Such measures include instructing office workers to work from home or in much smaller, segregated teams. Large events should be postponed where possible, or cancelled. Mandatory quarantines for all arrivals and social distancing should be strongly incentivised, with <a href="https://time.com/5802293/coronavirus-covid19-singapore-hong-kong-taiwan/">both carrot and stick</a>. The floating Petri dishes known as <a href="https://www.watoday.com.au/national/nsw/chances-are-might-get-it-2700-on-infected-cruise-ship-not-checked-upon-sydney-arrival-20200320-p54cdu.html">cruise liners</a> should be suspended immediately.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/03/social-distancing-small2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Those small acts alone would delay the spread, flatten the curve and possibly reduce the need for heavy-handed restrictions and the associated economic costs further down the road.</p><p><strong>3. Test early, test often, and test widely.</strong></p><p>Most people won't grasp the magnitude of the outbreak from the confirmed case data alone, at least not early enough for it to matter. So you need to test, test and test some more, and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html">not just people with symptoms</a>.</p><p>Given the incentives they face, unless policy-makers are able to comprehend the extent of the outbreak in the entire population, they won't be able to act appropriately. That means representative samples of the population should be taken and tested as often as possible, otherwise outbreaks will grow unnoticed to the point that localised lock-downs, as done in Vò, become infeasible.</p><p>If localised isolation won't work because you can't find outbreaks early enough, you're left with no option but relatively high-cost, mass isolation - a move that effectively resets the clock, allowing you to rapidly slow the spread before reverting to a localised lock-down model as outbreaks appear again (and they will). Unfortunately, that's the only option left for the majority of the world's governments, which have by and large botched their responses to COVID-19.</p><p>Finally, remember that even if measures to slow the virus are working, the data will look worse before it gets better. Given the lags mentioned above, it will be at least a week after any measure is implemented before dividends are seen in the data.</p><p>Stay safe and enjoy the rest of this week's issue. Cheers,</p><p>— Justin</p><h2 id="other-bits-of-interest">Other bits of interest</h2><h3 id="debt-is-a-magnifier">Debt is a magnifier</h3><p>John Cochrane writes:</p><blockquote>Our economy runs on a river of debt, and the debt clock keeps ticking when the economy shuts down. Had everyone kept a few months of cash around, things would be fine. But many did not. Now we are seeing the beginnings of a scramble for cash, as people and businesses try to sell assets or borrow. <br><br>Money troubles spread like a virus. When a business cannot pay, its creditors, employees, investors and banks are in trouble. And if people worry that banks and other institutions are going to fail, they run to get money out—and we have a crisis.</blockquote><p>Many companies - airlines in particular - were taking advantage of "unconventional" monetary policy to borrow a lot to buy back their own stock. That's fine when the going's good, and there's nothing wrong with buy backs in and of themselves (whether the tax system should incentivise debt and buybacks, as it currently does, is a separate question). But it also leaves you incredibly exposed when cash flows dry up. As John concludes, "When it's over, we need to start taking seriously that if you're too big to fail, you're too big to borrow.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19) has spread to the extent that for many countries, containment is impossible. The goal now is to delay the speed at which it moves through communities. That means cancelling public events, mandating self-isolation for recent overseas travellers and generally encouraging, or in many cases enforcing, "social distancing".</p><p>The above strategy is called "flattening the curve", which is fancy talk for attempting to limit the number of people - particularly critical cases - infected at any given time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/03/flatten-the-curve-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Failure to flatten the curve in a pandemic will overwhelm the health system, leading to forced rationing and many more fatalities <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-italy-doctors-tough-calls-survival/">than necessary</a>:</p><blockquote>With no clear sign of when the epidemic will spike, anaesthesiologists and doctors are being called on to make increasingly tough calls on who gets access to beds and respirators when there are not enough to go around. <br><br>"It is a fact that we will have to choose [whom to treat] and this choice will be entrusted to individual operators on the ground who may find themselves having ethical problems," said a doctor working in one of Milan's largest hospitals. <br><br>For now, the marching orders are: Save scarce resources for those patients who have the greatest chance of survival. That means prioritizing younger, otherwise healthy patients over older patients or those with pre-existing conditions.</blockquote><p>One form of "social distancing" is avoiding the workplace. We're still on the far left tail of the pandemic curve here in Western Australia, but I expect to have to work from home in the very near future.</p><p>And to be honest, the option is long overdue.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/03/meetings-email.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The gradual shift to more flexible working arrangements has been happening for some time, despite setbacks stemming from some short-sighted <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/coronavirus-is-a-preview-of-our-self-isolating-future-f5e73b046104">research</a> and push-back from "old school" managers and executives (likely because they're the ones who would have to adapt the most to the change):</p><blockquote>The [remote work] movement was slowed by a mid-decade backlash, headlined by former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer’s 2013 ban on employees working from home. Aetna, Best Buy, and IBM also moved to curtail the practice in subsequent years. They were acting on research that suggested a remote workforce is bad for collaboration. <br><br>In just the past few years, however, that equation has changed. Workplace communication software, such as Slack and Zoom, has moved both the water cooler and the conference room online. Enterprise platforms like Asana and Jira, Salesforce and Netsuite, G Suite and Office 365 look the same whether you’re in the office or in a different country. Corporate VPNs extend the company firewall to remote devices.</blockquote><p>While it's true that it's also not yet possible for all workplaces to shift to a remote work model, many of today's jobs are already just as ably performed from home as they are in an office, a <a href="https://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/Automated-truck-expansion-Pilbara">mine site</a> or a <a href="https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/doing-business/logistics/cargo/containers/50-years-of-containers/the-robot-is-coming">port</a>.</p><p>The coronavirus has effectively forced a large, real-world experiment, with many organisations forced - whether prepared or not - to send their employees home. Suddenly apps like Slack, which are costly <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/slacking-off/">time sinks</a> in an office setting, start to add value in terms of real-time collaboration (but please if you're considering Slack, at least try a privacy-friendly option first, such as <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase Teams</a>).</p><p>The transition to working from home over such a short period of time will be messy and challenging for employers, as not all are equipped to deal with it equally. But I suspect that, given enough time, many will be surprised by how easy the transition actually is and how little productivity is affected, if at all.</p><p>As you might expect, Silicon Valley leads the way, with many companies already fully remote. Here is GitLab's "<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/">remote manifesto</a>":</p><ul><li>Hiring and working from all over the world <em>instead</em> of from a central location.</li><li>Flexible working hours <em>over</em> set working hours.</li><li>Writing down and recording knowledge <em>over</em> verbal explanations.</li><li>Written down processes <em>over</em> on-the-job training.</li><li>Public sharing of information <em>over</em> need-to-know access.</li><li>Opening up every document for editing by anyone <em>over</em> top-down control of documents.</li><li>Asynchronous communication <em>over</em> synchronous communication.</li><li>The results of work <em>over</em> the hours put in.</li><li>Formal communication channels <em>over</em> informal communication channels.</li></ul><p>This is one of those occasions where, given the choice, you don't want the experiment to happen. Many people will die and the world will likely fall into a deep recession as a result of this virus (mostly from containment efforts/restrictions, rather than the virus itself). But at least there might be <em>some</em> lasting good to come out of it.</p><h2 id="other-bits-of-interest">Other bits of interest</h2><h3 id="the-uk-s-controversial-coronavirus-strategy">The UK's controversial coronavirus strategy</h3><p>We're getting natural experiments in disease control, too. There have so far been two strategies in dealing with the virus, full containment (e.g. China, Singapore), or herd immunity. The UK appears to have opted for the latter:</p><blockquote>Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, said on BBC News: “There’s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you’ll want to cocoon, you’ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don’t catch the disease and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity’s been achieved in the rest of the population.”</blockquote><p>Infect the young and healthy (gradually - so still ban large gatherings, but leave schools open), isolate the vulnerable, and hope that after a bit of time the virus is no longer able to spread effectively. The only problem is we don't yet know how long immunity to this virus will last - for life, or just a few months? Will it just boomerang back next flu season and infect everyone all over again anyway (this is an even bigger risk for 'containment' countries)? It's too early to know, but the UK is definitely taking the higher risk, higher reward option.</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work">Herd immunity: will the UK's coronavirus strategy work?</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/iandonald_psych/status/1238518371651649538">Twitter thread by Professor Ian Donald</a></li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22577132">Hacker News thread on the UK's strategy</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1238865934179340294">Critique of the UK strategy by Nassim Taleb</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamAEden/status/1238865629437775872">Critique of the UK strategy by William Eden</a></li></ul><h3 id="against-a-stimulus-response">Against a stimulus response</h3><p>Arnold Kling writes:</p><blockquote>I believe that the best macroeconomic response to the virus crisis would be what I call forbearance. Bank regulators would tell banks that they will be allowed to fall below minimum capital requirements. They will be allowed to write down the value of loans without having to raise capital as a result. They will be encouraged to in turn offer forbearance to borrowers, provided that there is a reasonable prospect that borrowers will be able to get repayments back on track once the crisis has passed. <br><br>Under this policy, it will be up to banks to decide which borrowers are in short-term difficulty and which borrowers are never going to recover. If I were at a bank, I would bet on airlines coming back. I would not bet on cruise ships coming back.</blockquote><p>I concur that fiscal stimulus and monetary easing will not help much in this crisis, where much economic activity has effectively shut down due to the coronavirus. Central banks should keep the plumbing operational to prevent an unnecessary financial crisis, but that's it. Fiscal support should be targeted where possible, healthcare obviously but also helping businesses that can survive with a little short-term help. No blanket bail-outs. For example it's not clear, as Kling notes, that cruise operators should be bailed out. Or, say, highly leveraged US shale producers.</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/the-case-for-forbearance/">The case for forbearance</a></li><li><a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-supply-chains-china-46d82a0f-9f52-4229-840a-936822ddef41.html">Coronavirus has disrupted supply chains for nearly 75% of U.S. companies</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's official, Libra as it was originally conceived is dead. Facebook has ceded to regulatory pressure and is now going to market <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-scales-back-libra-plans-bowing-to-regulators">without</a> the cryptocurrency backed by a basket of assets as an option:</p><blockquote>Succumbing to pressure from regulators, Facebook has decided not to make the proposed Libra currency available on its own services for the time being, and will instead offer its users digital versions of government-backed currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the euro, according to three people familiar with the matter. Facebook still plans to go ahead with the launch of a digital wallet that would allow users to make purchases and send and receive money, though it will delay the rollout by several months.</blockquote><p>This is what happens when you try to disrupt a heavily concentrated, politically-connected sector <strong>and let it know ahead of time</strong>. Facebook should have developed Libra in secret, released it, and then dealt with the regulators. The last thing a bureaucrat wants is a surprise as it forces them to actually deal with it.</p><p>So what's left of the Libra project? Without the cryptocurrency, there's basically no innovation at all. "Digital versions of government-backed currencies" already exist in spades, and its Calibra digital wallet has been delayed until at least October.</p><p>If Facebook didn't have an enormous network effect and the ability to force users of its other services (WhatsApp and Messenger are the prime candidates here) to eventually give it a try, it's hard to see anyone using whatever Facebook eventually trots out over a standard 'neobank' (digital-only bank). They've already been operating for years and are well integrated with establishment monetary schemes, <a href="https://mozo.com.au/international-money-transfer/articles/transferwise-up-bank-the-partnership-thats-set-to-make-sending-money-overseas-seamless">eg</a>:</p><blockquote>What do you get when you cross an international money transfer (IMT) provider with a neobank? A pretty cool collaboration. In a first of its kind, IMT provider, Transferwise and neobank, Up Bank have teamed up to make sending money overseas easier than ever. More than 130,000 Up Bank customers will now be able to send money internationally in 52 currencies, all from their transaction account.</blockquote><p>Moving into the payments space makes sense for Facebook, but it didn't think this one through at all. When something is <em>eventually</em> released, expect nothing more than a Facebook-integrated version of Venmo. And if we're being honest, that's probably what Facebook should have done from the start. It's now too big and too <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/the-regulated-love-regulations/">cosy with regulators</a> to disrupt anything.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now everyone should be aware of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). It's a cousin of the original SARS virus that's less deadly but far more infectious, and it's increasingly looking like the world's containment efforts have failed. Reported cases are still growing exponentially outside of China, particularly in Iran, Italy and Korea, and there's a good chance it's already running wild through continental Europe.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/03/covid-19-29-feb.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>The virus is growing exponentially in several countries outside of China.</figcaption></figure><p>Markets took a long time to react to this possibility, suggesting that the SARS experience and excessive faith in a government that sits on the totalitarian end of the spectrum in terms of human liberties may have caused some trepidation.</p><p>The city of Wuhan first announced that 27 people had fallen ill to a mysterious virus back on New Year's Eve, with the first cases officially diagnosed back on 10 January. Yet the S&amp;P500 rose another 3.7% (between 10 Jan - 19 Feb) before the correction commenced on 20 February, and it has since declined more than 10% from those highs.</p><p><strong>Faith, misplaced.</strong></p><p>For while China took drastic measures, it also did what every good communist does when something potentially damaging to its image, and thus its power, emerges.</p><p>Oppress it. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa83463a-4737-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441">Hard</a>:</p><blockquote>Piecing together the events in Wuhan shows that for at least three weeks before the [18 January] banquet, city authorities had been informed about the virus spreading in their midst but issued orders to suppress the news. In effect, they engineered a cover-up that played down the seriousness of the outbreak, according to officials and medical professionals. <br><br>The most fateful consequence of the official silence was that it facilitated the exodus of some 5m people in the weeks before the city was quarantined on January 22, thus helping to transport the virus all over the country and overseas. Slow and sometimes contradictory statements from the World Health Organization, which is responsible for warning the world of public health emergencies, also hampered early efforts to combat the crisis.</blockquote><p>The World Health Organisation naively <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3045770/world-health-organisation-links-china-virus-outbreak-single">took China at its word</a>, while behind the scenes the communist apparatus was working hard to quash any dissenting views. Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who challenged the official 'nothing to see here' narrative and sadly passed away as a result of the virus, was even ordered to sign a <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/13/li-wenliangs-death-exposes-the-costs-of-chinas-authoritarianism">confession</a> stating that:</p><blockquote>...his truth-telling was in fact a lie that “gravely disturbed social order”. Not content with forcing the doctor to deny reality, police added school-bully phrases, asking him to write “I can” and “I understand” when asked if he would now calm down and heed the police, or face legal penalties.</blockquote><p>China's President, Xi Jinping, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/world/asia/xi-china-coronavirus.html">admitted</a> he was aware of the outbreak more than two weeks before he ordered the full, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxepem/heres-how-china-is-hunting-down-coronavirus-critics">brutal</a>, lockdown of Wuhan, using China's love of technology to assist in tracking down rogue civilians:</p><blockquote>As China ramps up efforts to control the narrative around the coronavirus outbreak, it is also expanding its efforts to leverage online platforms to track down people who dare to speak out. From tracking down Twitter users using their mobile numbers to hacking WeChat accounts to find out someone's location, Beijing is eager to stop any negative news from being shared online — and is will to use intimidation, arrests and threats of legal action.</blockquote><p>In theory, a state with the power that China possesses over its people's liberties should be able to contain something like a flu with relative ease. In reality, the incentives faced by local officials all the way up to the President often result in the opposite, particularly in the early phases when decisive action is most important. The party comes before the people (but not before yourself). Always.</p><p>Note that I'm not saying other countries fare any better (with the exception of Singapore, whose government seems to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/100-a-day-for-those-quarantined-severe-penalties-for-people-who-flout-quarantine">understand incentives</a>). For example, in the United States - where everything must go through the CDC - testing for the virus has been <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/2/28/21155917/preparing-for-coronavirus-in-the-us-cdc-diagnostic-testing">chaotic</a>:</p><blockquote>The problem is that testing in the US has been limited so far, with only a small number of labs available to assess the results, flaws in the manufacturing of the earliest kits sent out to states, and out-of-date criteria for testing people. (Until Friday, most tests focused on people who’d been to China recently or those with known Covid-19 exposure.)</blockquote><p>Governments are naturally ill-prepared and disorganised for dynamic shocks such as an outbreak of a previously unknown virus. If it was the same virus every time, they'd nail it; but that's not how viral outbreaks work. Dealing with a crisis requires decisions to be made and approvals granted at many levels of government before formally responding, with each actor along the way afraid of being blamed for either taking the wrong action, or for inaction.</p><p>Those forces are stronger in China than elsewhere, where any mistake means your career - and life - are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51453848">at risk</a>:</p><blockquote>China has "removed" several senior officials over their handling of the coronavirus outbreak - as the death toll passed 1,000.  The party secretary for the Hubei Health Commission, and the head of the commission, are the most senior officials to be demoted so far.  The deputy director of the local Red Cross was also removed for "dereliction of duty" over "handling of donations".</blockquote><p>China butchered its handling of the outbreak, but we shouldn't have expected any better. What remains to be seen is whether the delayed but heavy-handed response will strengthen Xi Jinping's stranglehold on power or begin to undermine it.</p><p>As usual, there's plenty more in the bits below 👇 If someone forwarded this to you, you can <a href="https://econbyte.com/#subscribe">sign up for free here</a>.

I'm not sure it will be enough to trigger a global recession, but it will come very close given that the current expansion was looking long in the tooth already.</p><blockquote>One concern is that manufacturers that have so far used parts in stock or already in transit when China put itself on lockdown will suffer shortages of key components in the coming weeks, even as China’s manufacturers are slowly coming back online. <br><br>“When the last ships reach our harbors in a week or 10 days, that will be it from China,” said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China and chief local representative for German chemicals company BASF SE. “Then you will see shortages on the shelves of Europe. The impact has not really been felt yet.”</blockquote><p>Incidentally, the betting odds of a recession in Trump's first term (i.e. this year) have <a href="https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/4292/Will-there-be-a-recession-in-Trump's-1st-term">dropped dramatically</a> in the past two weeks and are approaching 50%.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-companies-brace-for-big-blow-from-coronavirus-11582718401">The German Economy Was Faltering, Then Came the Coronavirus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.axios.com/olympic-official-tokyo-cancellation-coronavirus-contained-4ca69a5a-b573-4ec5-8714-959d04ae8592.html">Tokyo is "looking at a cancellation" if coronavirus not contained by late May</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/26/microsoft-warns-it-will-miss-guidance-for-segment-that-includes-windows-because-of-coronavirus.html">Microsoft warns it will miss guidance for segment that includes Windows because of coronavirus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/technology/coronavirus-disrupts-industry.html">The Week in Tech: Coronavirus Disrupts the Industry</a></li></ul><h3 id="is-china-a-tech-threat">Is China a tech threat?</h3><p>I don't believe so.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what should come as a surprise to no one, Facebook is lobbying the European Union for regulations to govern artificial intelligence, content moderation and more. As we wrote way back in <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/why-facebook-shouldnt-be-regulated/">Issue 14</a>, "Facebook will be willing to pay the cost of being regulated if it means its competitors, both present and not yet conceived, will have to pay it as well".</p><p>Facebook is a big company and it already pays for an army of lawyers and content moderators, so new regulations are <em>relatively</em> less burdensome on it than its competitors.</p><p>But Facebook's <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/regulate-facebook/">latest lobbying</a> really is something else, because it turns out that it <em>already </em>complies with all of the regulations it's proposing:</p><blockquote>It's suspiciously convenient that Facebook already fulfills most of the regulatory requirements it’s asking governments to lay on the rest of the tech industry.‌‌‌‌[If the European Union regulators] follow Facebook’s suggestions, they might reinforce the social network’s power rather than keep it in check by hamstringing companies with fewer resources.‌‌‌‌Tech giants like Facebook have the profits lawyers, lobbyists, engineers, designers, scale and steady cash flow to navigate regulatory changes. Unless new laws are squarely targeted at the abuses or dominance of these large companies, their collateral damage can loom large. Rather than spend time and money they don’t have in order to comply, some smaller competitors will fold, scale back or sell out.</blockquote><p>Well said. Every increment on this front helps Facebook maintain its dominance. There will be benefits - improved privacy, perhaps - but the adverse implications in terms of stifling digital innovation will forever remain unseen. And I don't know about you, but the last company I would want enshrined as a regulated monopoly is a company run by Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>There's more on existing European regulations in the bits below. 👇</p><h2 id="other-bits-of-interest">Other bits of interest</h2><h3 id="the-economic-consequences-of-data-privacy-regulation">The Economic Consequences of Data Privacy Regulation</h3><p>According to a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3522845">new paper</a>, The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has not aged well:</p><blockquote>...a nonnegligible number of consumers exercised the opt-out right enabled by GDPR. At the same time, the remaining consumers are more persistently trackable. This observed pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that privacy-conscious consumers substitute away from less efficient privacy protection (e.g, cookie deletion) to explicit opt out, a process that would reduce noise on remaining consumers. Further in keeping with this hypothesis, we observe that the average value of the remaining consumers to advertisers has increased, offsetting most of the losses from consumers that opt-out.</blockquote><p>So privacy-conscious Europeans opted out of tracking, data collection and all of that nasty stuff following the roll-out of the GDPR, leaving a large (87.5%) pool of people who simply don't care enough. But that process has actually <em>helped</em> advertisers, as those annoying privacy-conscious individuals - who were likely using VPNs, ad blockers, fingerprint obfuscators and so on prior to the GDPR anyway - are no longer distorting the aggregate data. Brilliant!</p><p>My guess is that the 12.5% privacy-conscious Europeans also wouldn't consider using a FitBit unless it was first quarantined from Google. But that won't stop the European regulators...</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3522845">The Economic Consequences of Data Privacy Regulation: Empirical Evidence from GDPR</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/google-gobbling-fitbit-is-a-major-privacy-risk-warns-eu-data-protection-advisor/">Google gobbling Fitbit is a major privacy risk, warns EU data protection advisor</a></li></ul><h3 id="encrypted-email-follow-up">Encrypted email follow-up</h3><p><a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2020/everyone-spies-on-everyone/">Last week</a> I wrote about AT&amp;T's "decision" to block Tutanota, an encrypted email provider, and why encrypted email is generally not that useful anyway. This week security start-up Latacora also questioned its usefulness, in far more depth. But the conclusion is the same:</p><blockquote>Email is unsafe and cannot be made safe. The tools we have today to encrypt email are badly flawed. Even if those flaws were fixed, email would remain unsafe. Its problems cannot plausibly be mitigated. Avoid encrypted email.</blockquote><p>Don't bother with an encrypted email service. You're much better off using that money to pay for an email service that doesn't compromise usability somewhere outside the 5-eyes, using other products designed with encryption in mind from the get-go for everything else, such as Signal, Keybase or Riot.im (and Firefox Send for larger attachments).</p><p>Definitely not WhatsApp though.</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2020/02/19/stop-using-encrypted.html">Stop Using Encrypted Email</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7enqn/google-is-letting-people-find-invites-to-some-private-whatsapp-groups">Google Is Letting People Find Invites to Some Private WhatsApp Groups</a></li></ul><h3 id="hope-for-libra-yet">Hope for Libra yet?</h3><p>Maybe... just maybe. Shopify is massive but still far enough removed from the "establishment" that it might just be enough to get Libra going.</p><blockquote>After eBay, Visa, Stripe and other high-profile partners ditched the Facebook -backed cryptocurrency collective, Libra scored a win today with the addition of Shopify. The e-commerce platform will become a member of Libra Association, contributing at least $10 million and operating a node that processes transactions for the Facebook-originated stable coin.‌‌‌‌If Libra manages to assuage international regulators’ concerns, which are currently blocking its roll out, Shopify could gain a way to process transactions without paying credit card fees. Libra is designed to move between wallets with zero or nearly-zero fees. That could save money for Shopify and the 1 million merchants running online shops on its platform.</blockquote><p><strong>Link:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/21/shopify-libra/">Shopify joins Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra Association</a></li></ul><h3 id="buying-an-election">Buying an election</h3><p>Michael Bloomberg has been trying hard to buy the Democratic nomination, throwing a cheeky half billion (so far), or less than 1% of his net worth, at his campaign. It turns out he's spending a decent chunk of that on social media, buying memes, paying influencers to promote him, and even has his own little army of Twitter bots!</p><p>I tend to put a very low value on the influence possessed by 'influencers', so it will be interesting to see if this strategy pays off.

So machines will be dominant in the closed systems, whether it's games, or any other world designed by humans.</blockquote><p>I agree, with one example being completely driver-less (level 5) cars. Until all the non-passenger humans are off the roads - that includes pedestrians, cyclists, e-scooters, whatever - the openness of the system will remain a major (impossible?) hurdle for level 5 automation. Mine sites, ports, railways, warehouses? No problem.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend I pushed two major changes to the website:</p><ol><li>Changed hosts from <a href="https://ramnode.com/">Ramnode</a> to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>.</li><li>Migrated the back-end from <a href="https://craftcms.com/">Craft</a> to <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>.</li></ol><p>I'm not going to dwell on the first point. Ramnode has been great but I wanted <em>Finely Balanced</em> to have its own server rather than piggy backing on my existing, resource-constrained VPS. Why Digital Ocean? The major VPS providers for those on a budget - Ramnode, Vultr, and Digital Ocean - are very similar in terms of their offerings and pricing, but Digital Ocean had the best discount coupon at the time. That was it!</p><p>The second point is far more interesting. As regular readers know, I'm a big proponent of open source software. Yet this blog, while originally compiled with the open source <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, has been powered by the proprietary <a href="https://craftcms.com/">Craft CMS</a> since the transition away from EconByte over a year ago.</p><h3 id="why-not-craft">Why not Craft?</h3><p>Craft is incredibly powerful and allows you to build virtually any feature you could ever want into your templates. I had it to a point where it would generate two lots of code for every post, one styled with CSS for the website and the other with tables for the weekly email (damn you Microsoft!!). But there was still a fair amount of copy-pasting involved to take that output, plug it into a mailer and deliver it to subscribers every week.</p><p>It was also relatively tedious to achieve the formatting I wanted. I had to create "matrix" fields, each with their own sub-fields, and add each one individually to a post as I needed them. The output was perfect but writing a post wasn't fluid at all.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/craft-matrix.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Here's how the Bits looked in the Craft control panel.</figcaption></figure><p>Craft is also written in PHP, a coding language of which I'm not a huge fan. It's also <strong>closed source</strong>.</p><p>Given how much I write about the benefits of open source software, it was a bit inconsistent for me to be voicing that opinion on a closed source platform. So I decided to move the website to Ghost.</p><h3 id="why-ghost">Why Ghost?</h3><p>I've followed Ghost since its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform/posts">Kickstarter</a> days back in 2013 and even used it for a project shortly after its first public release. Back then it was very basic - not much more than an elegant Markdown editor with a few bells and whistles - but it has come a long way since.</p><p>Most importantly, Ghost 3.0 rolled out membership and subscription functionality, which allows me to email all <em>EconByte</em> subscribers directly from the control panel. It also released a new editor with Ghost 2.0 which makes writing a joy, is coded in Node.js not PHP, is open source, and allows anyone to self-host their own node, as we are doing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Here I am writing Issue 66 in Ghost's editor, to be delivered this week.</figcaption></figure><p>Regular readers of <em>EconByte</em> won't notice much difference, other than a completely redesigned newsletter (Ghost does not yet allow people to customise the newsletter template) and a missing search bar (another feature Ghost does not yet support). But those were two small trade-offs I was willing to make to save myself a lot of time and effort.</p><p>If you notice any issues other than those, please <a href="mailto:justin@finelybalanced.com">let me know</a>.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unless you've been living under a rock for the past decade or think that governments actually have your interests at heart, the 'revelations' last week that again confirmed the US, China and Australia all spy on us should not have come as a shock.</p><p>First, Australia. Remember that law that required the retention of people's metadata from just over a year ago (covered in <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2018/australias-encryption-gamble/">Issue 13</a>)? Yeah, turns out it's <a href="https://itbrief.com.au/story/metadata-retention-laws-abused-by-enforcement-agencies">being abused</a> to gather up even more data than was intended:</p><blockquote>The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) is conducting a review of the controversial metadata retention laws that require telecommunication companies to retain records of every single person’s calls, texts, and internet browsing history for at least two years. In hearings last week, the Commonwealth Ombudsman confirmed that law enforcement agencies are receiving URLs as part of the mandatory data retention regime, despite this practice being explicitly banned under the legislation. <br><br>“More than ever, this shows what was warned from the start – that the scheme would be abused, and safeguards overstepped. The government should immediately move to repeal this legislation, or at a bare minimum make significant improvements to bring it in line with Australia’s human rights obligations,” says Digital Rights Watch chair Tim Singleton Norton.</blockquote><p>Next up, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/02/us-gave-allies-evidence-that-huawei-can-snoop-on-phone-networks-wsj-says/">United States</a> accused China of spying:</p><blockquote>US officials say they have evidence that Huawei has backdoor access to mobile-phone networks around the world. <br><br>"We have evidence that Huawei has the capability secretly to access sensitive and personal information in systems it maintains and sells around the world," US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told the Journal.</blockquote><p>The audacity! Finally, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/02/huawei-fires-back-points-to-us-history-of-spying-on-phone-networks/">China </a>was having none of that and so it responded in kind:</p><blockquote>"As evidenced by the Snowden leaks, the United States has been covertly accessing telecom networks worldwide, spying on other countries for quite some time," Huawei said in a six-paragraph statement sent to news organizations. "The report by the Washington Post this week about how the CIA used an encryption company to spy on other countries for decades is yet additional proof."</blockquote><p>I'm beginning to sound like a broken record here but if there's one thing you can be certain about it's governments spying on each other and their respective citizens. It's why proper encryption and privacy legislation that enshrines that protection, rather than undermines it as Australia's does, are so important.</p><p>Yes, the Chinese government will try to spy on foreign citizens (and its own) by any means possible, and that includes the risk that it has asked Huawei to backdoor its hardware. So will Australia. So will the United States. And so on. I mean, the CIA has literally been using hardware backdoors <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/national-security/cia-crypto-encryption-machines-espionage/">for decades</a>:</p><blockquote>The company, Crypto AG, got its first break with a contract to build code-making machines for U.S. troops during World War II.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I might be jumping the gun a bit here (Libra hasn't even launched yet!) but the writing is on the wall. Eight founding institutions have now withdrawn from Facebook's Libra Association, with the Financial Times running <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/16bec8aa-42e8-11ea-a43a-c4b328d9061c">an article</a> last week detailing why Mastercard <em>officially</em>pulled out (for those unfamiliar with Libra, see our previous issues <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/meet-libra-facebooks-disrupter">here</a>, <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/the-libra-witch-trials">here</a> and <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/everyone-hates-libra">here</a>):</p><blockquote>Concerns about data integrity help explain why Mastercard pulled out of Libra, the Facebook-led digital currency project that was unveiled last year. Mr Banga likes the idea of a global currency and joined the association of companies backing Libra, but concerns over compliance and the business model led him to withdraw. <br><br>The association’s key members would not give a hard commitment to “not do anything that is not fully compliant with local law”. He points to due diligence considerations such as know your client, anti money laundering, data management, “all that . . . every time you talked to the main proponents of Libra, I said ‘Would you put that in writing?’ They wouldn’t.” <br><br>He also did not see how Libra would make money, and “when you don’t understand how money gets made, it gets made in ways you don’t like”. Finally, he was alarmed that Facebook had positioned Libra as a financial inclusion tool but then proposed linking it to a proprietary digital wallet, Calibra. <br><br>“It went from this altruistic idea into their own wallet. I’m like: ‘this doesn’t sound right’ . . . For financial inclusion, the government has got to pay you in this [currency], you’ve got to receive it as an instrument you can understand, and you have to be able to use it to buy rice and cycles. If you get paid in Libra [coin] . . . which go into Calibras, which go back into pounds to buy rice, I don’t understand how that works.” <br><br>Arguably, Mr Banga also has self-serving reasons for pulling back from Libra. Lisa Ellis, payments analyst at MoffettNathanson, thinks that it is possible that a blockchain-based payments system could, years in the future, grow into a real-time global payments network — posing an “existential threat” to private networks such as Mastercard.</blockquote><p>Mastercard joins Visa, eBay, Stripe, Vodafone, PayPal, Booking Holdings and Mercado Pago in quitting the Libra Association within a year of its formation, mostly due to "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910453/libra-association-facebook-visa-mastercard-stripe-leaving">regulatory expectations</a>":</p><blockquote>With the exception of eBay [and Vodafone], they’re all payment processors, which means they have specific regulatory requirements dealing with fraud, money laundering and sanctions enforcement. Governments were starting to realize that Libra might make it hard to meet those requirements — and payment processors in particular would end up on the hook.</blockquote><p>Fair enough. When your very profitable business model depends on keeping the regulators at bay, which is exactly where Mastercard has positioned itself, Libra is not a good look.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/mastercard-share-price.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The exit of payment providers should be a positive for Libra. It allows the Libra Association to push the limits a bit - actually do what Mr Banga has accused it of doing - which is, after all, why it was created.</p><p>But it won't.</p><p>No, the real problem is the Libra Association and its masters at Facebook, which have shown <a href="https://libra.org/en-US/compliance-consumer-protection/#overview">no sign</a> that they're willing to push <strong>any</strong>boundaries:</p><blockquote>The success of this venture depends on its trusted and safe integration with the existing financial system. The world’s governments, specifically regulatory and law enforcement authorities, are essential partners in this endeavor. <br><br>The Libra Association intends to work with policymakers as the ecosystem is developed and operationalized, and as regulations adapt to address innovation and other changes in the market.</blockquote><p>In other words, Libra's ability to disrupt the traditional financial system has been severely muted by... the Libra Foundation. Conforming to the world's financial regulations means resembling an existing financial institution. The only way Libra might have worked is with an Uber-style approach: launch first and have the regulators re-rewite the existing rules around you. If Uber had tried to 'integrate with the existing taxi system', it would have amounted to nothing more than an app that made ordering an artificially scarce taxi slightly less inconvenient.</p><p>The benefits to Mastercard - and all the other payment providers that have quit - of being a part of an association that's doomed to fail due to the inherent conflict in its approach are now virtually non-existent, but the costs of aggravating its regulatory masters are significant. Of course it was going to jump ship.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

And even telco carriers can encrypt calls and throw away the decryption key. <strong>End-to-end encryption is legal under current federal law</strong>. Yet the EARN IT Act would allow an unelected, unaccountable commission to write “best practices” (not actual laws or regulations, yet liability would result from failing to abide by them) which, make no mistake, will condemn end-to-end encryption. The commission, after all, would be acting in the shadow of an Attorney General who despises encryption. For Barr, encryption can only be a “worst practice.” By engaging in that “worst practice,” companies would risk facing the potentially ruinous tide of litigation that Section 230 presently bars. That is: the EARN IT Act would use one law -- a narrowed Section 230 -- to penalize providers for exercising their rights under a different law -- CALEA. Providers would be held legally liable for doing exactly what federal law permits them to do. <br>...<br>In short: This bill takes popular rage at social media companies’ immunity under Section 230 for public speech on their platforms, and twists it into a backhanded way of punishing messaging service providers’ use of encryption for private conversations. That’s the deeper bait-and-switch.</blockquote><p>I've discussed the current US Attorney General, William Barr, in this newsletter before. He <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/dont-have-a-barr-of-it">detests encryption</a> and will not stop until companies are forbidden from using it. If he gets his wish then millions of people the world over who passively rely on the encryption implemented by Big Tech will become more vulnerable to malicious actors. Banning encryption won't stop criminals from using it - you can't ban away the technology itself - but Barr doesn't care, so long as the US government can better spy on its own citizens.</p><p>Do read the <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it">rest of the article</a>.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

However, this technology is not a silver bullet that can guarantee you absolute privacy by itself. <br><br>First, there are backups. Users don’t want to lose their chats when they change devices, so they back up the chats in services like iCloud – often without realizing their backups are not encrypted. The fact that Apple was forced by the FBI to abandon encryption plans for iCloud is telling. <br><br>Second, there are backdoors. Enforcement agencies are not too happy with encryption, forcing app developers to secretly plant vulnerabilities in their apps. I know that because we’ve been approached by some of them – and refused to cooperate. As a result, Telegram is banned in some countries where WhatsApp has no issues with authorities, most suspiciously in Russia and Iran.</blockquote><p>Pavel (the co-founder of Telegram) has a vested interest here but it doesn't mean he's wrong: from a privacy perspective, WhatsApp is bad news.

In theory, the US is supposed to be willing to share important security information with the UK. But the US refuses to provide British intelligence with the evidence that it claims it has regarding the threat posed by Huawei. <br><br>That makes me think this is not really about national security; it’s part of the Trump administration’s goal of preventing China from becoming a great power. That might well be a valid objective, but if that’s what this is all about then we should say so. <br>...<br>I do see why people would be opposed to using Huawei infrastructure in military-related facilities.

It shows how much Apple has been willing to help U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, despite taking a harder line in high-profile legal disputes with the government and casting itself as a defender of its customers’ information.</blockquote><p>There's also <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3061660/whatsapp-is-storing-unencrypted-backup-data-on-google-drive">this</a> from last year:</p><blockquote>Facebook-owned instant messenger WhatsApp has admitted that it's storing unencrypted backup data on Google Drive... the act of encrypting the data between WhatsApp and Google is not part of the end-to-end encryption that the company offers for its conversations.</blockquote><p>If you believe Facebook, WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted (I certainly won't until it reveals its source code). But what most people don't know is that if you've enabled automatic backups - whether to Google Drive, Apple's iCloud, whatever - they're exported in plain text and encrypted with the company's private key, not yours. That effectively allows them to scan your conversations, package them up with all the other information they have about you, and sell it all to the highest bidder.</p><p>Or in the case of a government request, hand it over for free.</p><p>So once again: if you must use the products offered by the FAANGs, don't let them store your backups. Better yet, ditch them altogether.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian trial of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei and daughter of its founder, started this week. Meng was arrested as she was leaving Canada under orders by the United States for allegedly violating its sanctions on Iran. Given the ongoing trade war between China and the United States and the latter's decision to place Huawei on its "entity" list, i.e. "bad guy" list, the trial has taken on a bit more significance, and will play some role in how Huawei and Chinese technology companies in general are perceived in the future.</p><p>The United States has been out to get Huawei for <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/huawei-all-the-hate">some time</a>, using its global influence to thwart the company's attempts to sell 5G infrastructure. And so the imminent trial of Meng last week caused a few prominent economists/media personnel to weigh in as to whether or not Huawei is actually a threat to national security, the Western way of life... you get the picture. I'm going to focus on just one, blogger and usually sensible GMU <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-15/u-s-china-trade-deal-trump-is-the-winner-of-round-one">Professor Tyler Cowan</a>:</p><blockquote>…Currently the U.S. is working hard to keep Huawei equipment out of the forthcoming 5G networks in many countries. (Imagine letting the KGB run the American phone network in say 1980, and you can see what is at stake here.) For that campaign to succeed, even partially, the U.S. needs some credible threats of punishment, such as withholding intelligence or even defense protection from allies. The course of the trade war has made those threats more plausible. If you are Germany, and you see that the U.S. has been willing to confront the economic and military power of China directly, you will think twice about letting Huawei into your network.</blockquote><p>The analogy comparing Huawei's 5G hardware to the KGB "running" the phone network is so far off the mark it's not funny. Tyler's a smart guy and so he's being deliberately misleading here in an attempt to swing people to his side on the rather weak, broader point he's making in the article, which can be summarised as "America good, China bad".</p><p>Let's be clear about something: phone networks were (are) completely insecure. "Scramblers" were used to try and secure the lines but those were "often intercepted and decoded due to scrambling's inherent insecurity" (excuse the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_telephone">Wiki link</a>). If you owned the infrastructure, you owned the communications of that country.</p><p>Not so for today's internet, which we can and should in most cases secure both with end-to-end encryption (e.g. PGP) and encryption in transit (e.g. TLS). Whether companies implement it property or governments allow it (Australia, for example, has been trying to <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/australia-just-ban-it">ban encryption</a> for some time) is a discussion for another day, but it's not only technically possible but also relatively costless to properly secure communication over the internet, regardless of who owns the network infrastructure.</p><p>The real issue is that Americans like Tyler want their government to maintain control, and therefore its ability to surveil, the world's communication network. Americans have been putting backdoors into their hardware for decades (e.g. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cisco-backdoor-hardcoded-accounts-software,37480.html">Cisco</a>), and the government has been conducting mass surveillance of its, and other countries' people, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">even longer</a>. Tyler is not worried about the inevitable surveilling and privacy violations conduced by Chinese companies, just that they will provide the data to a foreign government rather than the American one.</p><p>Ultimately the Huawei debate is a red herring, which much like Tyler's KGB example is designed to distract people from the fact that US companies have fallen behind in the 5G space and their government is using every protectionist trick in the book in an attempt to give them a leg up. A far greater threat to the average American is their own government, which by imposing import tariffs and subsidising domestic producers is driving up their cost of living. It's also actively trying to <a href="https://econbyte.com/newsletter/2019/dont-have-a-barr-of-it">undermine encryption</a>, the only technology that can stop all governments (and companies), not just the Chinese, from violating their privacy.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue. Cheers,</p><p>— Justin</p><hr><h2 id="other-bits-of-interest">Other bits of interest</h2><h3 id="we-have-a-deal-">We have a deal!</h3><p>A deal is a deal and at least this conflict isn't escalating any more (for now):</p><blockquote>The U.S. and China signed what they billed as the first phase of a broader trade pact on Wednesday amid persistent questions over whether President Donald Trump’s efforts to rewrite the economic relationship with Beijing will ever go any further. <br><br>The deal commits China to do more to crack down on the theft of American technology and corporate secrets by its companies and state entities, while outlining a $200 billion spending spree to try to close its trade imbalance with the U.S. It also binds Beijing to avoiding currency manipulation to gain an advantage and includes an enforcement system to ensure promises are kept.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the hostility towards Chinese companies such as Huawei is achieving the opposite of the United States' goals, driving the Chinese government into providing additional support to its big tech companies, broadening global supply chains away from American companies:</p><blockquote>The result has been a decisive shift in China’s approach to the industry. Beijing is accelerating its drive for technological “autonomy” to boost its control over its own supply chain in the face of political risks, such as further US embargoes. <br><br>To achieve technological autonomy, Beijing is pursuing strategies that often tread an uneasy balance between increasing its engagement with the outside world and shutting it out. For all the accusations China has faced about stealing other countries’ technology, Beijing is now embracing international open-source, or free to use, collaborations. <br><br>China is also tapping overseas markets for talent, while it is investing more in tech in countries other than the US. <br><br>This acceleration of the decoupling will not only affect the US groups that rely on China’s custom, it will also start to reconfigure the world’s tech supply chain, as Chinese companies shift supply to countries they view as safer allies. The two superpowers are already bullying countries they buy from, and sell to, to take sides.</blockquote><p>The tariff man has his work cut out for him.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-15/u-s-china-sign-phase-one-of-trade-deal-trump-calls-remarkable">U.S. and China Sign Phase One of Trade Deal »</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/15/china-trade-agreement-seeks-to-combat-sale-of-counterfeit-goods.html">US-China trade deal seeks to combat sale of counterfeit goods »</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b">US tech backlash forces China to be more self-sufficient »</a></li></ul><h3 id="cognitive-automation-not-artificial-intelligence">Cognitive automation, not artificial intelligence</h3><p>Here's a good Twitter thread on why artificial intelligence is misnamed.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Economist Timothy Taylor wrote a <a href="https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2020/01/concentration-and-competition-ambiguous.html">blog post</a> last week, commenting that:</p><blockquote>“Concentration isn’t a good barometer of the extent of competition in the market,” says Chicago Booth’s Chad Syverson. “It’s not just a noisy barometer; we don’t even know what direction the needle is pointing. There are cases where, clearly, things happen in a market to make it more competitive, and concentration goes up.” <br><br>As an example, imagine rules that made made your personal data more portable. A step like this would probably encourage more competition in certain industries, because if your data moved with you, it would be easier to switch between phone companies, or banks, or health insurance providers. However, if it is easier to switch and competition goes up, a possible result is that the already-big providers grow even bigger, and concentration rises as well.</blockquote><p>I've written about rising industry concentration <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/the-age-of-centralisation">before</a>. It's not obvious it's a bad thing given how it has come about. Here it is visualised (the data are out of date but it's the best I've got):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/us-industry-concentration.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The rise in industry concentration appears to be happening because the most productive firms are becoming "superstars" by offering consumers lower prices (or no price), eliminating their less productive rivals. It should come as no surprise that the top five S&amp;P 500 companies today are Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook. But the way they became so big was by benefiting consumers, the polar opposite of industry concentration resulting from monopolistic behaviour, which is what antitrust was developed to combat (at least in theory). Tim concludes:</p><blockquote>In short, when thinking about the extent of competition in a market, and how certain antitrust or regulatory policies might affect competition, it's reasonable to look at measures of industry concentration and how such measures might shift. But before one has a knee-jerk negative reaction to measures of higher industry concentration, one needs to be quite specific about how concentration is being measured: how a specific industry is defined, and whether the focus is local, regional, or national. One also needs to be aware that higher competition can lead to higher concentration for an extended period of time.</blockquote><p>There's no doubt that, for example, the social media industry is heavily concentrated. But it's not clear that there's a lack of competition or monopolistic behaviour on behalf of the Facebook, nor is it clear that the social media industry should be defined as Facebook's version of social media (ever heard of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2019/06/04/is-fortnite-the-new-social-media-home-for-teens/">Fortnite</a>?). </p><p>There is, however, a risk that misdiagnosing the problem may lead to regulations that further entrench the incumbents over start-ups. Privacy regulations such as the one Tim mentioned above catch up, along with some ill-advised antitrust action as proposed by the likes of Warren, Sanders and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-07/china-targets-internet-giants-in-sweeping-antitrust-law-overhaul">the Chinese</a>, are two such examples. If concentration has risen as a result of increased competition then those actions may, perversely, solidify that concentration while muting competitive forces.</p><p>Note that Facebook's share price hit a record high last week and in his annual note, Mark Zuckerberg again <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2020/01/09/mark-zuckerbergs-message-to-the-us-government-in-annual-note-regulate-us-just-dont-break-us-up/">called for</a> his firm to be more heavily regulated. He's no fool.</p><h3 id="blockchain-and-sporting-contracts">Blockchain and sporting contracts</h3><p>Salary caps for sporting leagues are generally set on a single year basis, but teams often sign players on multi-year deals. That tends to result in some contracting shenanigans, with clubs front or back-loading contracts to create "windows" in which they can challenge for a title by essentially having a more talented squad than they would otherwise be able to afford. Enter blockchain:</p><blockquote><em>After nearly three months of delays, including a threat from the NBA to ban him from the league during negotiations, Brooklyn Nets point guard Spencer Dinwiddie plans to launch his token-based investment vehicle on Monday in conjunction with a bid to get selected to his first career All-Star Game.</em><br><br><em>Dinwiddie is going to sell his securities-backed SD8 tokens, which can’t be traded for a year, for $150,000 apiece to verified accredited investors under SEC Regulation D, Rule 506 (c). What he created, he said, allows players to structure and issue debt instruments in digital token form to invest their money how they’d like. It would function as a decentralization of the personal loan to athletes through bonds they create with their guaranteed contracts as collateral.</em><br><br><em>The SD8 coin will be a three-year bond expected to pay out 4.95% base interest on a monthly basis—much better than you’d be able to get at a bank—with the full principal paid out at the end of the period upon maturity in a bullet payment. The investment period will begin on Monday and end on February 10, with the bond notes maturing and paying out in full on February 10, 2023. According to a chart provided by Dinwiddie’s representatives, if all 90 coins were purchased, it would net investors just over $2 million over the course of the three years.</em></blockquote><p>By tokenising their contracts, professional athletes might be able to 'smooth' out these front or back-ended deals, equalising their pay across the duration of their contract in return for an annual interest payment.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shlomosprung/2020/01/10/spencer-dinwiddie-launching-digital-token-next-week-discusses-nbas-threat-to-terminate-his-contract/">Spencer Dinwiddie Launching Digital Token Next Week, NBA’s Threat To Terminate His Contract »</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/52682/nbas-spencer-dinwiddie-set-to-roll-out-tokenized-investment-platform-next-monday">NBA's Spencer Dinwiddie set to roll out tokenized investment platform next Monday »</a></li></ul><h3 id="the-reserve-bank-of-australia-dismisses-libra">The Reserve Bank of Australia dismisses Libra</h3><p>Imagine if the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was the regulatory body in charge of the internet? It would no doubt have concluded, as Paul Krugman did, that:</p><blockquote><em>By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.</em></blockquote><p>Like Krugman it would have been horribly, horribly wrong. The difference is that the RBA has the power to regulate Libra out of existence (at least in Australia); thankfully Krugman did not have that power over the internet. Here's the RBA:</p><blockquote><em>The G7 has cautioned that private sector global stablecoin initiatives should not be permitted to launch until all risks and regulatory requirements have been addressed. The [RBA] is supportive of this view.</em><br><br><em>In Australia, it is unclear that there will be strong demand for global stablecoins even if they do meet all regulatory requirements, particularly for domestic payments.</em></blockquote><p>Who cares if there's demand.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technological progress is essential for improving living standards. It plays a major role - albeit one that is difficult to accurately measure - in improving productivity, and therefore income, for people everywhere. There will always be short-term 'losers' (e.g. horse and buggy operators when motor vehicles were introduced), although even they - and to a greater extent, their children - will benefit from the increased productivity.</p><p>But sometimes new technologies are enthusiastically embraced without much concern for whether or not there are actually productivity gains to be had. Take classroom education technology:</p><blockquote><em>Schools across the country have jumped on the education technology bandwagon in recent years, with the encouragement of technophile philanthropists like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. As older education reform strategies like school choice and attempts to improve teacher quality have failed to bear fruit, educators have pinned their hopes on the idea that instructional software and online tutorials and games can help narrow the massive test-score gap between students at the top and bottom of the socioeconomic scale.</em><br><em>...</em><br><em>But much of the data shows a negative impact [of education technology] at a range of grade levels. A study of millions of high school students in the 36 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that those who used computers heavily at school “do a lot worse in most learning outcomes, even after accounting for social background and student demographics.” According to other studies, college students in the US who used laptops or digital devices in their classes did worse on exams. Eighth graders who took Algebra I online did much worse than those who took the course in person. And fourth graders who used tablets in all or almost all their classes had, on average, reading scores 14 points lower than those who never used them—a differential equivalent to an entire grade level. In some states, the gap was significantly larger.</em></blockquote><p>The [longish] <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614893/classroom-technology-holding-students-back-edtech-kids-education/">article</a> lists several reasons for why classroom education technology might be producing those negative outcomes, including distraction, the lack of motivation when learning from a computer versus a person, and the inability of computers to demonstrate the "social usefulness" of knowledge.</p><p>I tend to agree. It would appear that educators (or rather, the administrators which spend educational budgets) have been seduced by the allure of technology as a solution to all of their woes, investing heavily in devices and programmes that will do little to help students who, for whatever reason (there are many), are already struggling. The approach reminds me a lot of the blind embrace of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the potential of which has been (and continues to be) <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/artificial-intelligence-is-overrated">massively overrated</a>. The article continues:</p><blockquote><em>Judging from the evidence, the most vulnerable students can be harmed the most by a heavy dose of technology—or, at best, not helped. The OECD study found that "technology is of little help in bridging the skills divide between advantaged and disadvantaged students." In the United States, the test score gap between students who use technology frequently and those who don’t is largest among students from low-income families.</em></blockquote><p>Technology is no panacea. Politicians and educational administrators would do well to take a step back, slow down and actually think through the role technology can play in the classroom before bulk buying the latest device or educational app that promises to solve everything. Implemented properly, technology should produce educational gains for all, not just for students who are already doing relatively well. Simply spending more money on classroom education technology without first addressing the more fundamental, <em>actual</em> reasons why some schools and students are falling behind will only worsen the educational divide.</p><h3 id="another-artificial-intelligence-misapplication">Another artificial intelligence misapplication</h3><p>People, especially those in the tech industry, need to slow down and think a bit more. In this case, AI has been used to answer the wrong question. Essentially, Google's AI breast cancer screening system is flawed [it's a tweet storm so the grammar is poor and it's riddled with typos]:</p><blockquote><em>...if you unleash AI on a problem and prove you are better at finding biopsy proven cancer you have no idea if you are changing the ratio of </em><br><em>harmless to curable to spread-already.</em><br><br><em>And without knowing that you don't know you are helping.</em><br><br><em>When you change the rules around how the study is interpreted, you cannot be sure that the net result is better EVER if you find more cancer and EVEN if you find less non-cancer. Because you don't know: harmless from curable from spread-already ratios in what you find.</em></blockquote><p>Don't get me wrong, AI can and will be used for good and I don't doubt the motivations of those at Google who ran the experiment. But people need to think things through a bit more (something AI cannot do) and only use it in areas to which it is suited.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/VPrasadMDMPH/status/1212840987363442689">The Google AI mammogram paper is FLAWED [Twitter] »</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/cragcrest/status/1212736228640120833">Oh look, it's an example of AI being used to solve the wrong problem [Twitter] »</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/health/breast-cancer-mammogram-artificial-intelligence.html">Original NYT article "A.I.

Europe's 2018 "General Data Protection Regulation" (GDPR) was the holy grail of tech regulation, endlessly praised by techies as a model for the rest of the world to emulate. I was skeptical, writing in <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/why-facebook-shouldnt-be-regulated">Issue 1/2019</a> that:</p><blockquote><em>...while regulations such as GDPR might sound all warm and fuzzy, in practice they have few privacy-boosting effects. Indeed, the only thing the average user will have noticed as a result of the GDPR is the return of the annoying pop-up in the form a “we use cookies” consent box. Worse, it has already worked to further centralise power in the hands of Google and Facebook.</em></blockquote><p>It's now 2020 and that still holds:</p><blockquote><em>Aside from a €50 million fine that France's privacy regulator imposed on Google in January, there have been no fines or remedies levied at a U.S. giant since the GDPR came into effect.

They just hire lawyers and lobby politicians, delaying a resolution and in the process starve smaller competitors, both actual and potential.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Twitter, lit up the Twittersphere last week with a <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">tweetstorm</a> about his plans to potentially decentralise the service:</p><blockquote><em>Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard.</em><br><br><em>Twitter was so open early on that many saw its potential to be a decentralized internet standard, like SMTP (email protocol). For a variety of reasons, all reasonable at the time, we took a different path and increasingly centralized Twitter.</em></blockquote><p>I'm not going to lie, I'm a fan. Any time a billionaire running one of the largest social media platforms in the world wants to move toward decentralisation, it's a good thing. I've <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/platform-or-publisher">written before</a> about the unfortunate decisions companies such as Twitter and Facebook made by moving towards being publishers rather than platforms. A fully decentralised social media platform, upon which publishers (users) can build, would be a better model than what has become of the major social media sites today. For example, under such a model it wouldn't be possible for a <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/facebook-caves-singapore-censorship-writing-wall">Singaporean court</a> to order an American company to take down an Australian's content. Control, ownership and responsibility would be returned to the user, where it belongs.</p><p>But the problem Jack will inevitably confront will be how to decentralise the platform without compromising Twitter's ability to monetise its service. Most of Twitter's revenue comes from advertising, and advertisers love centralised, censurable publishers with captive audiences.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/twitter-revenue-by-source-2019.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>It's not like decentralised social networks haven't been tried before. For example Mastodon, diaspora*, pump.io, GNU social and Friendica, have all been around for a long time but have never really taken off outside of a relatively niche group of privacy enthusiasts.</p><p>But the potential difference this time - as with Facebook and Libra until it <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/the-libra-witch-trials">spectacularly caved</a> to establishment pressure - is that if Dorsey is serious, he has the resources to potentially mainstream the idea. He also has the technology, with <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766085037248512">blockchain</a> looking like the prime candidate to achieve his goal:</p><blockquote><em>...new technologies have emerged to make a decentralized approach more viable. Blockchain points to a series of decentralized solutions for open and durable hosting, governance, and even monetization. Much work to be done, but the fundamentals are there.</em></blockquote><p>Once again, what Dorsey is suggesting has been done before. <a href="https://golden.com/wiki/Peepeth">Peepeth</a>, for example, was a decentralised social network built on Ethereum that never took hold. Monetising social media with blockchain is not easy, either: while the technical problem of micropayments has mostly been resolved by blockchain, <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/micropayments-are-back-in-the-news">mental transaction costs</a> are still a very serious issue that have so far proved to be a hurdle too high. Essentially, people may hate adverts but they hate having to constantly approve transactions even more.</p><p>There's always a chance that Jack Dorsey and the enormous resources he has at his disposal will succeed, even if it would presumably involve a considerable adjustment to Twitter's business model and a huge coding feat for his new team of just <em>six</em> engineers. But as with Facebook and Libra, the establishment will be out to get him.</p><p>Is Jack's spine sturdier than the Zuck's? Time will tell. Good luck Jack, you'll need it.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue, and be sure to have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p><h3 id="facebook-s-fight-for-encryption">Facebook's fight for... encryption?</h3><p>This is odd coming from the company that makes its money by trading people's data:</p><blockquote><em>Facebook said it would not weaken end-to-end encryption across its messaging apps, despite pressure from world governments, in a letter to US Attorney General Bill Barr and UK and Australian leaders.</em><br><br><em>“It is simply impossible to create such a backdoor for one purpose and not expect others to try and open it,” wrote WhatsApp head Will Cathcart and Messenger head Stan Chudnovsky in Facebook's response. “People’s private messages would be less secure and the real winners would be anyone seeking to take advantage of that weakened security. That is not something we are prepared to do.”</em></blockquote><p>Look, she's absolutely correct. I just don't buy the claim that Facebook hasn't already undermined the encryption on its messaging applications by keeping its source code closed and 'safeguarding' everyone's master keys. But at least it's not sharing, right?</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-encryption-stays-bill-barr-letter-whatsapp">Facebook Tells US Attorney General It’s Not Prepared To Get Rid Of Encryption On WhatsApp And Messenger</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/technology/whatsapp-barr-encryption.html">Facebook and Barr Escalate Standoff Over Encrypted Messages</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-weighs-seeking-injunction-against-facebook-over-how-its-apps-interact-11576178055">FTC Weighs Seeking Injunction Against Facebook Over How Its Apps Interact</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-wont-change-web-tracking-in-response-to-california-privacy-law-11576175345">Facebook Won’t Change Web Tracking in Response to California Privacy Law</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-is-suing-to-send-a-message-to-scammers-and">Facebook The Plaintiff: Why The Company Is Suddenly Suing So Many Bad Actors</a> »</li></ul><h2 id="other-bits-of-interest">Other bits of interest</h2><ul><li><a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html">Quadratic Payments: A Primer</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-jobs-rich-cities-getting-richer/">For Tech Jobs, the Rich Cities Are Getting Richer</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/the-more-gender-equality-the-fewer-women-in-stem/553592/">The More Gender Equality, the Fewer Women in STEM</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/10/20996085/ai-facial-recognition-police-law-enforcement-regulation">How to avoid a dystopian future of facial recognition in law enforcement</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191208/19151943526/france-as-promised-is-first-out-gate-with-awful-copyright-directive-law-ignores-requirements-user-protections.shtml">France, As Promised, Is First Out Of The Gate With Its Awful Copyright Directive Law</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3bbq4/podcast-livestreams-hacked-ring-cameras-nulledcast">Inside the Podcast that Hacks Ring Camera Owners Live on Air</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-china-analysis/softbanks-china-strategy-wobbles-as-key-bets-disappoint-idUSKBN1YH28R">SoftBank’s China strategy wobbles as key bets disappoint</a> »</li></ul><h2 id="this-week-s-data-breaches">This week's data breaches</h2><p>When you sign up to a service in almost all cases they will sell whatever data about you they possibly can, more so when they're "free" (<a href="https://finelybalanced.com/disclaimer">we don't</a>!).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's just so simple, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/bernie-sanders-releases-broadband-plan-targets-comcast-att-verizon.html">isn't it</a>:</p><blockquote><em>Bernie Sanders unveiled a plan Friday to expand broadband internet access as part of a push to boost the economy and reduce corporate power over Americans.</em><br><br><em>In his <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/high-speed-internet-all/" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprawling “High-Speed Internet for All”</a> proposal, the Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate calls to treat internet like a public utility. His campaign argues that the internet should not be a “price gouging profit machine” for companies such as Comcast, AT&amp;T and Verizon.</em><br><br><em>Sanders’ plan would create $150 billion in grants and aid for local and state governments to build publicly owned broadband networks as part of the Green New Deal infrastructure initiative. The total would mark a massive increase over current funding for broadband development initiatives. The proposal would also break up what the campaign calls “internet service provider and cable monopolies,” stop service providers from offering content and end what it calls “anticompetitive mergers.”</em></blockquote><p>Regular readers will be aware that I'm extremely sceptical of grand plans to "fix" <em>anything</em> by effectively nationalising it. Down here in Australia we're still paying the price for such ill-conceived plans, hastily drawn up on the back of a bar napkin without so much as a cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>Sure, the current broadband situation in the United States could be far from optimal. But when determining how to improve the current arrangement, more care needs to be taken than simply looking at the number of firms in a given market (or perceived lack thereof) and concluding that they're all part of a "price gouging profit machine". Given the specificity of broadband infrastructure, large up-front capital costs and ongoing regulatory factors that broadband providers must overcome, it's likely that the optimal number of providers is actually relatively small.</p><p>But back to Sanders. How is he planning to achieve his plan to nationalise broadband? Our old friend antitrust, misapplied <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20998849/bernie-sanders-rural-broadband-access-internet-cable-monopolies-antitrust-election-2020">yet again</a>:</p><blockquote><em>Sanders’ plan also outlines a broader antitrust effort against internet and cable companies. If elected, he would use existing antitrust law to “bar service providers from also providing content and unwind anticompetitive vertical conglomerates.”</em><br><br><em>This policy could potentially impact every major US carrier, particularly Comcast’s ownership of NBCUniversal, AT&amp;T’s ownership of WarnerMedia, and Verizon’s ownership of AOL. “We will break these monopolies up and closely regulate them to ensure they are providing consumers with acceptable service, and eliminate hidden fees, surprise bills, and other consumer-gouging practices,” Sanders said.</em></blockquote><p>It's not obvious that these companies are monopolies or that antitrust should apply to them. It's not even clear that the mergers cited above have moved the market away from what could be called the 'optimal' structure, once prices <strong>and</strong> non-price variables (e.g. quality) are considered. There is no way that Sanders has done the huge amount of background legwork necessary to support his claims. He's just applying his ideology to a sector that every other Democratic candidate seems to be hating on. When you're Bernie Sanders, any perceived problem can be solved by making it "free".</p><p>But Sanders' ideology is not the issue here; it's the use of antitrust, yet again, to tackle the supposed problem. Antitrust is woke again and is being horribly abused across the developed world to beat down everything from Facebook to Comcast, with a complete disregard of the unintended consequences that will inevitably ensue.</p><p>On that note, there was an excellent Bloomberg article last week about Hollywood's experience with antitrust and how it ultimately "replaced the diverse ecology of working actors, staff writers, B-movies and cheap tickets at second- and third-run theaters", with a "winner-take-all system of star talent and blockbuster bets":</p><blockquote><em>Today, as a resurgent left, sometimes joined by the populist right, demands a return to punitive taxes and blunderbuss enforcement of U.S. antitrust laws, the Hollywood experience offers a timely reminder of how economic crusaders can destroy what they don’t understand. By hampering creativity and increasing risk, ill-informed antitrust action can ultimately harm the consumers it is supposed to protect.</em><br><br><em>“Today, not only do our metropolitan areas have many multiplex cinemas showing films from different distributors, but much of our movie-watching is not in theaters at all,” said Delrahim, who oversees the Justice Department’s antitrust division.</em><br><br><em>“It is important,” he said, “for antitrust enforcers to recognize the risks of misapplying antitrust law in creative fields that experience significant change.”</em></blockquote><p>Do read the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hollywood-shows-antitrust-laws-flop-160001638.html">whole thing</a>. One outcome of Sanders' plan, if implemented, will be to stifle innovation in the broadband sector. Once the fixed-line broadband network becomes utilitised, it will provide an incentive to regulators and politicians (the de facto new owners) to prohibit competition with that network, for example from wireless broadband. The United States is <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/first-they-came-for-huawei">already well behind</a> the likes of China in that space because "the broadband spectrum needed to create a successful network was reserved not for commercial purposes but for the military", making it "significantly slower and more expensive to roll out than just about anywhere else", and Sanders' plan will set it back even further.</p><h3 id="uber-banned-in-london">Uber banned in London</h3><p>This actually happened two weeks ago but it's still newsworthy, as Europe is ground zero in terms of misapplying antitrust toward digital technology.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3039254/chinas-cryptocurrency-miners-look-capitalise-policy-shift">SCMP</a>:</p><blockquote><em>"China’s cryptocurrency miners are cautiously celebrating a government decision not to ban the energy-intensive industry even as authorities launch a fresh crackdown on trading virtual currencies, though operators remain wary of more robust regulation in the future.</em><br><br><em>In a surprising policy shift in late October, China’s economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), removed cryptocurrency mining from a list of activities set for elimination by the end of 2020.</em><br><br><em>Although trading cryptocurrency is banned in China, mining is not, and the country dominates 70 per cent of global mining operations thanks primarily to cheap electricity supply.</em><br><br><em>Its nearest competition, India and the United States, accounted for 4 per cent and 1 per cent of total mining share respectively."</em></blockquote><p>Let me quickly clarify something: cryptocurrency mining is not innovating. China has excelled at mining because it has access to relatively cheap real estate, skilled labour, broadband and electricity. The one exception might be on the hardware side, where some innovation has occurred in terms of maximising efficiency, with China's Bitmain (75%) and Canaan (15%) <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmains-new-ipo-attempt-in-jeopardy-as-in-fighting-goes-public">dominating</a> the cryptocurrency mining hardware market. But Chinese companies are still laggards in terms of their development and implementation of blockchain technology.</p><p>However, the decision not to ban cryptocurrency mining is important when taken in the context of President Xi Jinping's <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3034716/chinese-president-xi-jinping-calls-more-research-investment">recent speech</a>, during which he declared that blockchain would play:</p><blockquote><em>"An important role in the next round of technological innovation and industrial transformation. As such it should be made a key part of the country's innovation programme, and investment in the sector should be increased.</em><br><br><em>Major countries are stepping up their efforts to plan the development of blockchain technology. Greater effort should be made to strengthen basic research and boost innovation capacity to help China gain an edge in the theoretical, innovative and industrial aspects of this emerging field."</em></blockquote><p>By no means should China now be considered 'friendly' to crypto. Remember that it's still <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bitcoin-mining-china-ban-crypto-cryptocurrency-wechat">illegal</a> to use Chinese yuan to buy crypto, or exchange crypto for yuan, and rightly or wrongly China is cracking down hard on on crypto exchanges peddling what it calls "air tokens":</p><blockquote><em>"It's obvious the Government is nervous about all these unsavory "air token" projects 空气币 (slang for scam project). And it will continue to rout these sorts of things from China. The bigger question though is the long-term fate of legitimate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. With investments from the likes of the ShuiMu QingHua BlockChain Fund, it’s way too early to say that the Government has fully embraced "blockchain not bitcoin." But it has made it clear that air tokens—and the exchanges that promote them—will vanish into the air. Or be suffocated."</em></blockquote><p>Any attempt by the Chinese politburo to centrally plan the direction of Xi's "innovation capacity" will be doomed to failure (Soviet jet trains anyone?), but if it takes a hands-off approach and gets the incentives right then there's no reason why China won't eventually move beyond mining hardware innovation and lead the charge on the software side as well. It's just not yet even remotely clear that's the path China is heading down.</p><p>Personally, I still think that the United States is where the next major blockchain breakthrough will emerge (noting that could be a new crypto, e.g. what Libra threatened to be, or an at-scale, real world implementation of an existing crypto), even if its <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/the-libra-witch-trials">Congress</a> seem intent on playing whack-a-mole on any mainstream attempts to innovate in this space.</p><h3 id="softbank-has-the-world-s-biggest-ponzi-scheme">SoftBank has the world's biggest Ponzi scheme</h3><p>I'm sorry but there is nothing visionary about Masayoshi Son's "Vision Fund", just a good old fashioned Ponzi scheme:</p><blockquote><em>"Since unveiling his $100 billion Vision Fund in 2016, Son has become the most active tech investor on the planet, pouring money into more than 80 companies. That helped create a bumper crop of unicorns, more than 300 startups priced at $1 billion or greater, according to the research firm CB Insights.</em><br><br><em>When SoftBank buys shares in a startup and then invests again at a higher valuation, Son says he has made a profit. That is legal under accounting standards, but SoftBank receives no money. The only change is that SoftBank has boosted the value of its original stake from, say, $1 billion to $2 billion by raising the value of the startup. In SoftBank’s income statements and return calculations, at least some of the additional $1 billion can be counted as profit.</em><br><br><em>Son’s bookkeeping has allowed him to claim his average internal rate of return far outpaces those of other investors. This month, as SoftBank took a hit from WeWork, Son defended his investment approach. “There are 5,000 venture capitals globally and average IRR is 13%,” he said. “Our return is about twice as big as this."</em></blockquote><p>Son spotted an opportunity in outdated accounting standards and the tech bubble, that's all. His returns are on paper only, achieved by throwing billion after billion at hundreds of actual and potential 'unicorns', at increasingly inflated valuations, over several funding rounds. This will not end well for Son's investors.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-26/after-wework-softbank-s-startup-bookkeeping-draws-scrutiny">After WeWork, SoftBank’s Startup Bookkeeping Draws Scrutiny</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="hsbc-moves-to-the-blockchain">HSBC moves to the blockchain</h3><p>Financial services are the most obvious low-hanging fruit for blockchain technology (that and things like land titles).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don't know what everyone's favourite eccentric billionaire, Elon Musk, has been smoking (<a href="https://youtu.be/ycPr5-27vSI?t=7827">or do I</a>), but Tesla's latest "innovation" really is something else. Meet the "<a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Cybertruck</a>":</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/elon-cybertruck-fail.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>This is not a joke. I repeat, this is <strong>not</strong> a joke. The image above is Elon Musk standing next to the Tesla Cybertruck, after a demonstration of the patented "armour glass" failed when hit with a softly thrown metal ball.</p><p>As for the design, it's almost as if a child whipped it up in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e074oj/thank_you_elon_very_cool/">MS Paint</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/elon-age-4.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The Cybertruck has to be just about the ugliest vehicle ever conceived, perhaps with one exception: Homer Simpson's... Homertruck?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/homers-cybertruck.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>In all seriousness, Tesla is once again in the headlines. If that was the goal then bravo Elon Musk, you sure know how to get people riled up about a product. But I think the Cybertruck is just <em>too much</em>. Sure, Tesla might have nearly <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280">200,000 pre-orders already</a> but Musk conveniently omitted the fact that all you need to do to get on the list is put down $100. Oh and it's fully refundable if you change your mind, too.</p><p>As it turned out, the Cybertruck launch topped off a particularly bad week for Elon Musk (note that Tesla's share price immediately fell ~6%), after a SpaceX prototype for his planned human-rated Starship rocket <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-explosion-today-starship-prototype-exploded-during-test-at-boca-chica-texas-launch-site-wednesday/">blew up</a> during a pressurisation test.</p><p>Marketing gimmicks aside, something has to be rotten at multiple levels if something as grotesque as the Cybertruck managed to get past the early development phase, let alone become an actual product. To make matters worse for Tesla, the electric vehicle market will <a href="https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/electric/future-electric-cars-upcoming-evs/">seriously heat up</a> as the majors get their acts together.</p><p>I certainly wouldn't be buying a Tesla.</p><h3 id="another-let-off-for-huawei">Another let-off for Huawei</h3><p>Sanctioning Huawei was never actually about Huawei.

It was an impassioned speech by Cohen, as you might expect from a well-known actor, but his argument was weak and shows just how wrong you can go when you start with a false premise. He offers up a lot of 'solutions' to the social media 'problem', with these the clearest:</p><blockquote><em>"Maybe it’s time to tell Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of these companies: you already allowed one foreign power to interfere in our elections, you already facilitated one genocide in Myanmar, do it again and you go to jail...</em><br><br><em>It only seems fair to say to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter: your product is defective, you are obliged to fix it, no matter how much it costs and no matter how many moderators you need to employ...</em><br><br><em>It’s time to finally call these companies what they really are—the largest publishers in history. And here’s an idea for them: abide by basic standards and practices just like newspapers, magazines and TV news do every day."</em></blockquote><p>He wants social media companies to be regulated as publishers, not platforms. This is not a new idea. It's also <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/platform-or-publisher">a terrible idea</a>.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/22/sacha-baron-cohen-facebook-would-have-sold-final-solution-ads-to-hitler">Sacha Baron Cohen: Facebook would have let Hitler buy ads for 'final solution'</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191122/00412943432/sacha-baron-cohen-is-wrong-about-social-media-wrong-about-section-230-even-wrong-about-his-own-comedy.shtml">Sacha Baron Cohen Is Wrong About Social Media, Wrong About Section 230...

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More specifically, the regulatory behemoth that is the European Union:</p><blockquote><em>"Regulators in Brussels have been heralded as the world’s leading tech industry watchdogs. But Mr. Stables and other veterans of the Continent’s antitrust battles are telling American authorities, who are investigating Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, something else: There is a lot to learn from Europe’s mistakes."</em></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/business/europe-technology-antitrust-regulation.html">NYT article</a> the quote above was pulled from notes that while the European Commission has taken plenty of action against the likes of Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook (fining them billions of dollars), it hasn't achieved the desired outcomes.</p><p>In typical NYT fashion, those outcomes aren't specified, with the article just trotting out the usual anecdotes from failed businesses along the lines of "Google stopped sending free traffic to my site". It also fell back on the ultimate rent seekers in this space, antitrust lawyers, who want - you guessed it - "tougher rules, including expanding the scope of antitrust enforcement into new areas of the digital economy".</p><p>Europe's approach to big tech is a dangerous one, but not in the way the NYT claims. Antitrust regulation is not simple and it's not obvious that big tech companies in their current forms should be subject to it. Yes, they have the advantage of network effects, but that certainly didn't help MySpace, Friendster, Bebo, OpenSocial, ConnectU, or Vine - and those are just <em>some</em> of the competitors that Facebook has seen off. These big tech companies operate in highly contestable markets and keep prices low (or don't charge anything!). Sure, they have advertising platforms but they face fierce competition on that front too, not just from each other but from traditional media such as television.</p><p>Worryingly, it could be much worse. The US has so far taken a mostly hand-off approach, although that might change regardless of who wins the Presidency given the attitude of Trump's Attorney General <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/dont-have-a-barr-of-it">William Barr</a>.</p><p>But the proposals offered by some of the Democratic Presidential candidates are particularly disturbing. While their ability to execute and enforce those proposals is a separate issue, the ideas themselves are straight out of <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/the-war-on-big-tech">Margrethe Vestager</a>'s play-book, the nutter at the helm of the European Commission for Competition.</p><p>I've already covered a few of <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/warren-the-populist">Warren's</a>, so here are some of the 'tech guy' <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/blog/regulating-technology-firms-in-the-21st-century/">Andrew Yang's</a> worst, who has promised that as President he would:</p><ul><li>Work with companies to create algorithms that minimize the spread of mis/disinformation, and information that’s specifically designed to polarize or incite individuals.</li><li>Require algorithms on platforms that allow political advertisements or the sharing of news stories to be open source, or confidentially disclosed to the Department of the Attention Economy.</li><li>Set new standards and metrics for antitrust, including size of data assets and lack of business formation.</li></ul><p>You read that right, a "Department of the Attention Economy". Yang wants to create a big new tech bureaucracy that will regulate everything from political advertisements to social media and even video game prizes, such as loot boxes. All in the name of <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/effects-smartphones-human-development/">protecting the children</a>, of course. What could possibly go wrong?</p><h3 id="meet-google-the-evil-company">Meet Google, the evil company</h3><p>Remember when I said Google <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/googles-not-so-bad">wasn't so bad</a>? It's bad all right, just less bad than certain ISPs. Now the evil company wants to enter the banking world, although much like the Apple card it will be a half-hearted, mainstream offering with Citigroup running the back-end. Presumably Google will provide a nice app and zero/low fees, a loss leader enabling it to gather financial data about its users which it can sell to advertisers.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/how-google-interferes-with-its-search-algorithms-and-changes-your-results/ar-BBWOCm2">How Google Interferes With Its Search Algorithms and Changes Your Results</a> »</li><li><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/13/google-apple-card-chequing-account-feature/">Google to take on Apple Card with chequing account feature next year</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/google-begins-testing-extension-manifest-v3-in-chrome-canary/">Google Begins Testing Extension Manifest V3 Which Kills Adblockers</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/google-political-ads-polls-email-collection/">How GOP-linked PR firms use Google’s ad platform to harvest email addresses</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/google-medical-data-project-nightingale-secret-transfer-us-health-information">Google's secret cache of medical data includes names and full details of millions</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790">Google’s ‘Project Nightingale’ Gathers Personal Health Data on Millions of Americans</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/im-the-google-whistleblower-the-medical-data-of-millions-of-americans-is-at-risk">I'm the Google whistleblower.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does Google leverage its users' browsing history and personal emails for profit? Of course. But at least it's upfront about it. Not so your <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/isps-lied-to-congress-to-spread-confusion-about-encrypted-dns-mozilla-says/">internet service provider</a> (ISP), to which you probably pay a decent sum every month for access to the internet:</p><blockquote><em>ISPs have consistently claimed such [broadband privacy] rules aren't necessary because they aren't violating users' privacy. But their objections to DNS over HTTPS "has raised questions about how ISPs collect and use sensitive user data in their gatekeeper role over Internet usage," Mozilla told Congress. Mozilla said it believes the privacy upgrade has "become necessary to protect users in light of the extensive record of ISP abuse of personal data."</em><br><br><em>That ISP abuse includes mobile providers selling real-time location data "to third parties without user knowledge or meaningful consent;" ISPs such as Comcast "manipulat[ing] DNS to serve advertisements to consumers;" Verizon's use of "supercookies" to track Internet activity; and AT&amp;T charging customers an extra $29 per month to avoid "the collection and monetization of their browsing history for targeted ads," Mozilla told Congress.</em><br><br><em>Web users are tracked by Google, Facebook, and other advertising companies, of course. ISPs, though, have "privileged access" to users' browsing histories because they act as the gateway to the Internet, Erwin said to Ars.</em><br><br><em>There is already "remarkably sophisticated micro-targeting across the Web," and "we don't want to see that business model duplicated in the middle of the network," he said. "We think it's just a mistake to use DNS for those purposes."</em></blockquote><p>Technology such as DNS over HTTPS (DoH), properly implemented at the browser level, will destroy the business model mentioned above (for a technical summary, see Issue <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/mozilla-internet-villain">32/2019</a>). A more transparent ISP model is - from my perspective at least - a good thing, although it might mean prices have to rise a small amount.</p><p>So who will ultimately convince Congress, privacy advocates or ISPs? Interestingly, the United Kingdom <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/24/mozilla_backtracks_doh_for_uk_users/">successfully persuaded</a> Mozilla not to enable DoH by default for its citizens:</p><blockquote><em>Firebox builder Mozilla has confirmed to UK Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan that Britons won't be getting DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) by default once the feature is included in the next run of browser updates.</em><br><br><em>In a letter to the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Mozilla's global policy veep Alan Davidson said his Silicon Valley org "has no plans to turn on our DoH feature by default in the United Kingdom and will not do so without further engagement with public and private stakeholders."</em></blockquote><p>I can't see Congress banning DoH, a move which would have severe unintended, security-related consequences. But it might find itself lobbied sufficiently to instruct Google (Chrome) and Mozilla (Firefox) not to enable it by default, as did lobbyists in the United Kingdom. Given most users generally roll with the default settings, that outcome will probably continue feeding enough data to the ISPs for them to continue operating with their existing advertising-based business models. But at least there's the option to opt-out.</p><p>For those who want to enable DoH now (you really should), here's how:</p><p><strong>Brave</strong></p><p><code>brave://flags/#dns-over-https</code></p><p><strong>Chrome</strong></p><p><code>chrome://flags/#dns-over-https</code></p><p><strong>Edge (new Chromium version only)</strong></p><p><code>edge://flags/#dns-over-https</code></p><p><strong>Firefox</strong></p><p><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_enabling-and-disabling-dns-over-https">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_enabling-and-disabling-dns-over-https</a></p><p>And finally, <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS#publicly-available-servers">here's a list</a> of publicly available DoH servers, should you wish to change from the default provider.</p><h3 id="the-list-of-shame-continues-to-grow">The list of shame continues to grow</h3><p>What do big corporations and Hollywood have in common?

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital privacy is important, but involves potentially costly trade-offs: unless you're willing to cede <em>some</em> privacy, you'll miss out on a seemingly ever-growing number of services which depend on your data to function. The Snowden revelations and subsequent concerns about the level of data we freely give away to both corporations and governments may have shifted the landscape slightly toward more privacy, but we are still some way from knowing what the <em>right</em> level of privacy actually is.</p><p>But at least consumers are now aware of the privacy trade-off and most just don't care: abuses of user data are regularly reported in the media yet judging by their actions, the vast majority of users seem to place a low value on privacy. For a quick and dirty proof of that, just take a look at Facebook's user count and revenue, both of which continue to grow despite the numerous, well-publicised exploitations of its own users' privacy.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/facebook-users-and-revenue.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>But at least with Facebook people are free to leave and sign up to a more privacy-friendly alternative if they so choose, or even eschew social media altogether. When governments abuse people's privacy it's not so simple, with the United States a major offender, having <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/31/aclu_facial_recognition/">built a database</a> containing every American's face:</p><blockquote><em>It also emerged in June that the FBI has a larger database of over 640 million faces, compiled from states' driver licenses, that it also allows its agents to search against. That database is seemingly run by an internal FBI unit called Facial Analysis, Comparison and Evaluation (FACE), though a GAO report appeared to indicate that the database is routinely accessed by cops as well as the Feds, with the database being questioned more than 390,000 times since 2011.</em><br><br><em>The policies covering use of that database is still unknown, as are the systems that federal government uses to carry out facial recognition. What is known is that several companies have contracts with the government for facial recognition, including Amazon. Again, the details of those contracts are unknown.</em></blockquote><p>As the article states, technology in this area has has outpaced civil rights laws and it's not as though a driver's licence or state-certified ID, used to compile the original database, are easy to do without. Worse, local authorities have already sold the data meaning it's now a part of both public and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/43kxzq/dmvs-selling-data-private-investigators-making-millions-of-dollars">private</a> databases. </p><p>If the United States is doing it, you can bet your bottom dollar that other, less privacy friendly nations, are doing the same. As the FT <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/68155560-fbd1-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6">reported</a> last week, China is using "emotion recognition... to identify criminal suspects":</p><blockquote><em>“Using video footage, emotion recognition technology can rapidly identify criminal suspects by analysing their mental state . . . to prevent illegal acts including terrorism and smuggling,” said Li Xiaoyu, a policing expert and party cadre from the public security bureau in Altay city in Xinjiang. “We’ve already started using it.”</em><br></blockquote><p>The problem is, it's not very good at what it purports to achieve (like most AI):</p><blockquote><em>Companies around the world, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, are all developing emotion recognition, but scientists say the technology does not work very well. “This technology is still a bit of a gimmick and is unlikely to be rolled out on a large scale in the next 3-5 years,” said Ge Jia, an influential Beijing-based technology blogger.</em></blockquote><p>Something not working well has never stopped a government from persisting to the bitter end in the past, especially when it just might help it shore up control of its people, for example by oppressing minority groups (this tech has been rolled out in Xinjiang, where most of China's Muslim Uyghurs live). In the meantime they will keep collecting data that will be stored forever and it's not clear how, even with strong new privacy laws, this can ever be unwound.</p><p>Except, perhaps, with <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-fantasy-of-opting-out/">obfuscation</a>, which if done on a large enough scale, will <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/big-irrelevant-data">render "big data" irrelevant</a>:</p><blockquote><em>At its most abstract, obfuscation is the production of noise modeled on an existing signal in order to make a collection of data more ambiguous, confusing, harder to exploit, more difficult to act on, and therefore less valuable. Obfuscation assumes that the signal can be spotted in some way and adds a plethora of related, similar, and pertinent signals — a crowd which an individual can mix, mingle, and, if only for a short time, hide.</em><br><br><em>There is real utility in an obfuscation approach, whether that utility lies in bolstering an existing strong privacy system, in covering up some specific action, in making things marginally harder for an adversary, or even in the “mere gesture” of registering our discontent and refusal.</em></blockquote><p>There are numerous products that help with obfuscation, for example by <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/how-to-block-fingerprinting-with-firefox/">instructing Firefox</a> to block browser fingerprinting, or by installing browser add-ons such as <a href="https://bengrosser.com/projects/go-rando/">Go Rando</a>, which "randomly chooses your emotional "reactions" on Facebook, interfering with their [sic] emotional profiling and analysis".</p><p>Compared to opting out of services altogether which, as mentioned, often comes with significant costs, obfuscating your digital activity is relatively cheap.

"Instead, I believe the better approach is to work to increase transparency. Ads on Facebook are already more transparent than anywhere else."</em></blockquote><p>Now here's Dorsey's take:</p><blockquote><em>"It's not credible for us to say: 'We’re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad…well...they can say whatever they want!'"</em></blockquote><p>While neither platform has any obligation to allow freedom of speech, Facebook's selective enforcement of political adverts - effectively <em>playing politics</em> - bothers me far more than Twitter's "go elsewhere" stance.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/twitters-ban-on-political-ads-will-hurt-activists-labor-groups-and-organizers-c339908b841d">Twitter’s Ban on Political Ads Will Hurt Activists, Labor Groups, and Organizers</a> »</li><li><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/468216-zuckerberg-doubles-down-on-facebook-political-ads-policy-after-twitter-ban">Zuckerberg doubles down on Facebook political ads policy after Twitter ban</a> »</li><li><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/twitters-ban-on-political-ads-will-hurt-activists-labor-groups-and-organizers-c339908b841d">Facebook’s political ad ban created a disaster in Washington state</a> »</li></ul><h2 id="other-bits-of-interest">Other bits of interest</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/china-wants-communist-party-members-to-pledge-loyalty-on-blockchain">China Wants Communist Party Members to Pledge Loyalty on Blockchain</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/russia-controversial-sovereign-internet-law-goes-into-force.html">Russia just brought in a law to try to disconnect its internet from the rest of the world</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-waterfront-toronto-votes-to-move-forward-with-sidewalk-labs/">Waterfront Toronto moving forward on Sidewalk Labs’s smart city, but with limits on scale, data collection</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-01/google-walmart-drive-india-payments-past-1-billion-transactions">Google, Walmart Help Drive India Payments Past 1 Billion Transactions</a> »</li><li><a href="https://soranews24.com/2019/11/03/microsoft-japans-experiment-with-3-day-weekend-boosts-worker-productivity-by-40-percent/">Microsoft Japan’s experiment with 3-day weekend boosts worker productivity by 40 percent</a> »</li></ul><h2 id="image-of-the-week">Image of the week</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/musk-solarcity-tesla-trial-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The Musks borrow heavily against equity in their businesses and regularly receive margin calls.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're back! For those who wondered where the newsletter went, I was <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/miscellaneous/2019/a-brief-hiatus">off in Japan</a> watching the Wallabies crash and burn out of the Rugby World Cup. Rugby Australia needs a complete overhaul and while the coach has gone, the rot runs far deeper. Unfortunately, I'm not sure anyone with sufficient influence has the backbone to mess with the New South Wales old boys' club and push for what's required.</p><p>Speaking of lacking a backbone, during a six hour Congressional hearing last week Mark Zuckerberg basically conceded that his cryptocurrency Libra, as originally defined in the white paper, is no more. A shame, really, as Libra executed properly by a company with the resources of Facebook really could have caused some of the welfare-boosting financial sector disruption that the world desperately needs.</p><p>But the assault on Facebook, the Zuck and Libra by the House Financial Services Committee, of which Libra was the centrepiece, makes me certain he <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/028d0a">doesn't have the stomach</a> to pull it off:</p><blockquote><em>The roughly six-hour hearing saw Zuckerberg fumble questions from the House Financial Services Committee about how the external Libra Association will be funded, what kinds of regulations should apply to Libra, how Facebook plans to make money from Libra, and how policies like refunding fraudulent transactions will work.</em><br><br><em>“Frankly, I’m not sure we learned anything new here as policy makers,” the ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Patrick McHenry, said in a closing statement.</em><br><br><em>What Zuckerberg did make clear is that Facebook won't launch Libra without proper regulatory approval in the U.S., and that Facebook would withdraw from the Libra Association if the group eventually decided to move forward on its own without the approval of U.S. regulators. But Zuckerberg's testimony didn't shed any light on what specific laws Facebook thinks should govern Libra.</em></blockquote><p>Zuckerberg is distraught and at this point will clearly do anything to appease the political class and maintain his 'woke' status. It was, after all, only a couple of years and several scandals ago that he was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103385178272401">travelling around the country</a>, presumably to boost his profile as 'one of the common people' prior to a possible 2020 run at the Presidency. He will fold at every opportunity and waiting for "regulatory approval", for a supposedly disruptive cryptocurrency, essentially spells the end for what Libra was <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/meet-libra-facebooks-disrupter">supposed to be</a>. </p><p>Worse, it seems further concessions have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-worldbank-facebook-idUSKBN1WZ0NX">already been suggested</a>, with David Marcus - head of Facebook's Libra project contribution - "open to looking at alternative approaches".</p><p>Facebook's lack of gumption aside, some of the questioning at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isTB1Bpl9SA">hearing</a> titled "An Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors", was disgracefully <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/10/whos-a-russian-asset.html">outlandish</a>:</p><blockquote><em>How many companies in the Libra association are headed by LGBTQ people? Isn't it true that Libra is a project of white men? What are you doing for African Americans whose lives you have ruined? Do you discuss white supremacy at your far right dinner parties?</em></blockquote><p>Six hours of democracy at its finest. As a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zuckerberg-vs-the-permissioncrats-11572040726">recent OpEd</a> in the Wall Street Journal aptly stated, "Facebook is hardly problem-free (though its effect on elections is grossly exaggerated). In the annals of mankind, permission-denying politicians are likely to remain the bigger problem".</p><p>RIP Libra and potentially the United States as disruptor in chief, if the openly anti-innovation House Financial Services Committee is any representation of the country as a whole.</p><h3 id="good-news-from-australia-bad-news-from-india">Good news from Australia, bad news from India</h3><p>The safety / privacy trade-off is one of the more important debates in which most governments are unwilling to engage (their incentives align them to a strong security bias). But in Australia at least there is some limit to the seemingly never-ending erosion of digital privacy:</p><blockquote><em>"An ambitious but controversial plan for a central identity database of Australians has been rejected by the Federal Parliament's security and intelligence committee. The bill [would have allowed] the Department of Home Affairs to collect, verify and share identity information across Commonwealth and state and territory governments and included plans for a face verification service that would make it easier for documents containing photos of people to be verified online."</em></blockquote><p>Elsewhere, India has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/technology/facebook-europe.html">copied the EU</a> and dived right into the rabbit hole of worldwide content removal, attempting to impose its local laws on companies and people in other countries.

All of these articles are from last week:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/760478177/microsoft-president-democracy-is-at-stake-regulate-big-tech">Microsoft President: Democracy Is At Stake.

But what is unusual are the attacks from within the United States, where antitrust is running riot (and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/how-antitrust-became-pro-pollution-tool/597712/">not just</a> against Big Tech). Here's how the antitrust lawyers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/09/google-antitrust-investigation-monopoly">might</a> target Google:</p><blockquote><em>"Experts believe the investigation could focus on at least one of three areas that have caught regulators’ eyes.</em><br><br><em>A good first place to look might be online advertising. Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes, because the alternative could be not reaching customers. “There’s definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,” King said.</em><br><br><em>Another visibly huge piece of Google’s business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing against the fine.</em><br><em>...</em><br><em>The US justice department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of big tech, as has the House judiciary subcommittee on antitrust."</em></blockquote><p>Just because a company has a large market share in a narrowly-defined market does not mean it's a monopoly. Largely obsolete antitrust legislation, inappropriately applied to Big Tech, will only result in an inferior outcome. It's a waste of time for both the regulators - who could be addressing real problems - and Big Tech companies, which have to hire small armies of lawyers to defend themselves.</p><p>Who pays for all of those wasted resources? Consumers, the supposed victims for whom antitrust was originally created to assist. The same people who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/opinion/tech-backlash.html">actually don't mind</a> Big Tech:</p><blockquote><em>"Consider Facebook: It’s hard to imagine a more backlashable company. Facebook is widely associated with data breaches, the spread of dubious information and a basic deterioration of interpersonal communication. It was recently fined nearly $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for mishandling its customers’ data. And, given its ubiquity, it’s also a handy stand-in for the corporatization of online life in general. If you’re going to make a show of quitting a tech service, Facebook may be your best choice.</em><br><br><em>But according to its most recent quarterly report, the number of Facebook accounts used daily (1.59 billion) and monthly (2.4 billion) each increased by 8 percent over the prior quarter. Despite all the anecdotes you’ve heard about people deleting their accounts, the company’s flagship app added about a million new daily users in the United States alone. Revenue was up 28 percent. Even factoring in the F.T.C. fine, Facebook recorded a profit of $2.6 billion.</em><br><br><em>Facebook is not the only demonized tech platform; social media companies in general are routinely criticized as toxic swamps full of trolls, liars and bots. But again, there’s no evidence of any exodus. In the same quarter, Twitter added five million new daily users, and Snap reported that the daily user base of its flagship Snapchat app grew 7 percent, its best-ever performance as a public company. According to the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of Americans use some form of social media, a percentage that has risen steadily for years and shows no sign of flagging. (The people I know who quit Facebook all use Facebook-owned Instagram, WhatsApp, or both.)"</em></blockquote><p>I personally don't use Facebook, try not to use Google and don't worry about any Big Tech company eventually behaving like a monopoly, because if they did the dynamism of the sector within which they operate would quickly relegate them to history's scrapheap of has-beens.</p><p>Ultimately the war on Big Tech is nothing but a witch hunt by politicians and regulators serendipitously preying on people's fears to further their own careers. If they succeed, the products many people enjoy using every day will become worse, or stop improving, with the major risk being that the war on Big Tech results in what it's supposed to be preventing: the <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/why-facebook-shouldnt-be-regulated">utilitification</a> of the incumbents.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: this will be the last weekly update until after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Rugby_World_Cup">Rugby World Cup</a>, or the Wallabies are eliminated, whichever comes first (who am I kidding; it's definitely going to be when the Wallabies are eliminated).</p><h3 id="california-has-a-lot-of-bad-ideas">California has a lot of bad ideas</h3><p>If something sounds too stupid to be true, you can be sure they've got it in California. First, rent control:</p><blockquote><em>"Landlords treated by rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15 percent by selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings. Thus, while rent control prevents displacement of incumbent renters in the short run, the lost rental housing supply likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of the law."</em></blockquote><p>Second, forcing Uber and Lyft drivers to become employees, thus eliminating "multihoming" (i.e. driving for multiple rideshare companies at once):</p><blockquote><em>"When drivers and consumers multihome, idleness further falls to zero as it involves costs for each platform that are appropriated, in part, by their rival. Interestingly, socially superior outcomes may involve monopoly or competition under various multihoming regimes, depending on the density of the city, and the relative costs of idleness versus consumer disutility of waiting."</em></blockquote><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/economy/california-rent-control.html">California Approves Statewide Rent Control</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/pdf/doi/10.1257/aer.20181289?return_path=/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20181289&amp;etoc=1">The Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality: Evidence from San Francisco</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/uber-lyft-drivers-are-one-step-closer-to-becoming-employees-in-california/">Uber, Lyft drivers are one step closer to becoming employees in California</a> »</li><li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3208616">A Theory of Multihoming in Rideshare Competition</a> »</li></ul><h2 id="other-bits-of-interest">Other bits of interest</h2><ul><li><a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/09/11/amazons-quantum-ledger-database-now-generally-available/">Amazon’s Quantum Ledger Database is now generally available</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-collects-face-data-now-what-it-means-and-how-to-opt-out/">Google collects face data now.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those out of the loop, World Health Organisation <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/21/robert-mugabe-made-goodwill-ambassador-world-health-organisation/">goodwill ambassador</a> and murderous dictator Robert Mugabe passed away last week at the ripe old age of 95. Apparently he will be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49619144">granted</a> national hero status and an official mourning. It would be funny if it weren't so sad; Lord Acton really was spot on when he <a href="https://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html">opined</a> that "Great men are almost always bad men", a description which fits Mugabe to a tee.</p><p>Moving on, this week I want to touch on Palantir Technologies, named after the "seeing stones" in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. The original "big data" company, Palantir last week <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/palantir-reportedly-seeking-private-funding-delaying-ipo-2019-9">announced</a> that it may delay its IPO until 2023:</p><blockquote><em>"Palantir, which has never been profitable, had reportedly been making efforts to gear up a public offering, which included hiring its first sales team and eliminating lavish employee perks, like 13-course tasting-menu lunches, that could raise eyebrows among public market investors. Employees were also reportedly no longer allowed to expense last-minute international airfare and at least one person was fired for expensing off-the-wall purchases like lingerie."</em><br><br><em>Because of Palantir’s work with the US military and government agencies, the data-mining firm has long been subject to scrutiny by outside critics. Most recently, Business Insider learned that Palantir employees themselves were becoming increasingly split over the company’s ties to government work – specifically its business dealings with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency involved in detaining and deporting people over immigration violations."</em></blockquote><p>What does Palantir do? No one really knows, but the evidence seems to suggest a mix between <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-specifically-does-Palantir-do">talent arbitrage</a>, i.e. consulting, and software development (mostly data analysis tools). Its major clients include <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/08/09/report-palantirs-u-s-government-contracts-top-1-5b.html">governments</a>, which were always going to be the primary buyers of "big data" services. Why? The lack of market feedback - knowledge transmitting prices, profit and loss - makes it hard to know which decisions might be best and how to justify them. Bureaucrats are also easily enticed by anything that might add "rigour" to their work, regardless of whether or not it adds real value.</p><p>For that reason, I'm sceptical of Palantir's lofty promises. While not being profitable doesn't (yet) matter in this day and age: Amazon wasn't profitable for nearly 6 years; Twitter, 4; and Uber and Lyft may never make a profit, there still needs to be some plausible future upside. It was clear what the likes of Uber and Lyft did and might dominate someday, for example autonomous vehicles, but Palantir? Not so much.</p><p>For me, Palantir is up there with Google's DeepMind in terms of its real world applications, i.e. not many. Provided it doesn't run out of money first, it will continue to win government contracts and work at organisations which resemble governments, such as large financial institutions, utilities and perhaps universities. But anyone else that dips their toes into the big data Kool-Aid will quickly realise how useless most of the output actually is and promptly walk away. Unless you need a veil of opacity with which to cloak your work, big data are not the answer.</p><h3 id="antitrust-will-be-the-weapon-used-against-big-tech">Antitrust will be the weapon used against big tech</h3><p>A poor argument rarely stops a lawyer, and especially not those spending other people's money to chase a big case.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of you are, by now, aware of the ongoing turmoil in Hong Kong. While like most I have an opinion on various aspects of it, I'm not going to get into that here and will instead focus on the technological side. Specifically, that throughout the drama there has been an ongoing battle between protesters and police taking place in the background, with the latter trying - and struggling - to identify members of the protesters, presumably so that they can be detained at a later date.</p><p>In their latest attempt to "unmask" front-line protesters, the police even <a href="https://qz.com/1699859/hong-kong-police-shooting-blue-dyed-water-at-protestors/">added blue dye</a> to their water cannons:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/hk-blue-dye2-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Not exactly high-tech but potentially effective; the protesters are, after all, normal people with jobs or classes to which they must attend during the week. It'll be pretty obvious to everyone what you were up to on the weekend if you show up looking like a smurf.</p><p>But the reason the police have resorted to such low-tech solutions is because they have been trying, with limited success, to both discover the identities of protesters and intercept their communications using more sophisticated means. Their problem is that almost everyone protesting in Hong Kong covers their face and wields an umbrella, and even <a href="https://observers.france24.com/en/20190806-hong-kong-protesters-use-lasers-confuse-police-damage-cameras">shoot lasers</a> that interfere with the government's facial recognition cameras. They also <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-08-14/hong-kong-protesters-challenge-surveillance-apps-and-umbrellas">encrypt their communications</a> using popular messaging apps such as Telegram:</p><blockquote><em>"They have lots of phones and they're using forums. They have their own forums and they're using Telegram as a place where they hold a lot of these discussions. In fact, apologies for yesterday's incident came out of these forums there — the soul searching, and 'we shouldn't ever let this happen again' came out of these forums. So I don't really know how it will play out, but everybody's so digitally adept.</em><br><em>...</em><br><em>Obviously, the phones are tracked and they're aware of it. Some of them have multiple phones and some of them turn off their phones. They wear a lot of masks and [they use] umbrellas to block CCTV when they get off at a subway station: The first one jumps out and opens umbrellas covering all the visibly closed circuit CCTVs. And then when they want to make decisions, they open their umbrellas and huddle under it. It's not fully protective against surveillance, but just like many other ... surveilled [people], when I asked them if they were worried about surveillance, they usually say, "There's so many of us. There's hundreds of thousands of us in the streets." And that's probably their only real protection. I don't think they can [remain undetected] even with their umbrellas and cool tactics. I don't think they can avoid the surveillance, so they're just counting on the fact that they probably cannot jail that many of them all at once."</em></blockquote><p>Encryption has thwarted many an attempt by the Hong Kong police to gather evidence, to the point that they even resorted to the ol' <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/technology/hong-kong-protests-facial-recognition-surveillance.html">wrench technique</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/xkcd-wrench-technique-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><blockquote><em>Mr. Cheung, a skinny 29-year-old, was grabbed at a mall around noon on July 18, according to his account. Four plainclothes officers waited for him to unlock his phone and then jumped on him, trying to pry it out of his hands.</em><br><br><em>After the officers tried to use his face to unlock the phone, they took him to a police station, where, he said, he was roughed up and interrogated. Later, officers went to his home and used a USB drive loaded with hacking software to break into his computers, according to his account of the incident. He said that he had been held for more than 10 hours and that he was not sure how the police had identified him.</em></blockquote><p>You can take steps to protect your data, for example as Mr Cheung did by using a privacy-friendly messaging app such as Telegram, but ultimately it all comes down to your threat model, and the protesters may have got this one wrong.</p><p>While it might help prevent the police gather evidence, whether or not their messages are encrypted is largely irrelevant; they are, after all, using Telegram as a forum/group chat, i.e. for mass communication, something easily intercepted regardless of whether or not it's encrypted (it only takes one 'insider').</p><p>What matters is whether or not individuals in those chats <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hong-kong-protesters-warn-of-telegram-feature-that-can-disclose-their-identities/">can be identified</a>, something that is still possible in Telegram group chats:</p><blockquote><em>"Per reports, an attacker can add tens of thousands of sequential phone numbers to a phone's address book. The attacker then connects to a Telegram channel where protests are being organized and syncs their contacts with the Telegram app.</em><br><br><em>At this point, the Telegram app will tell the attacker which of the sequential phone numbers has an account active on the protesters' group.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week President Donald Trump escalated his trade war with China (FYI his frequently updated <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/">Twitter feed</a> is a near-endless source of amusement), citing theft of intellectual property and a lack of what he calls "Far and Balanced Trade" (not properly defined). But the thing is, Trump's tariffs are only possible because of Section 232 of the <em>Trade Expansion Act</em> of 1962, which allows a President to impose tariffs if "an article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten or impair the national security".</p><p>There's nothing in there about intellectual property or "fair and balanced trade", just national security. He even opted to name-drop the <em>International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977</em>, a scary piece of legislation that effectively gives the President the power to freeze people's assets, block their private transactions and even confiscate property. Provided he can prove that there's an "unusual and extraordinary threat... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States", that originates "in whole or substantial part outside the United States", that is. But that's the thing about national security; deliberately opaque and ill-defined, it's a brilliant method that an executive, empowered by decades of Congress undermining itself, can use to justify almost anything.</p><p>The same might be said for antitrust, which is topical at the moment as people who dislike Big Tech are trying to use it as a cudgel with which beat it down, provided they can prove sufficient "market power" (like national security,not properly defined). This isn't a new phenomenon, either; even the now defunct MySpace was once accused (and acquitted) of an antitrust violation, when the CEO of its former owner <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20061103/165559.shtml">sued it</a> for refusing to link to his website.</p><p>Alas history tends to repeat, and it appears some are beginning to worry that a few Big Tech companies have been satisfying their customers for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/states-reportedly-plan-monopoly-investigation-of-google-facebook-amazon/">far too long</a>:</p><blockquote><em>"Big Tech will soon be facing too many antitrust probes to count on one hand, as several states reportedly plan to launch their own joint investigation to accompany all of the federal inquiries already in progress. Attorneys general for as many as 20 states may be joining forces to dig into whether the dominant tech players use their outsized market power unfairly to quash competition, sources tell the Wall Street Journal.</em><br><em>...</em><br><em>The specific targets of the probe were not named but are widely considered to include Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google—all of which are the targets of other antitrust probes, both in the US and abroad—at a minimum."</em></blockquote><p>Not content with services that actually exist, Facebook might even cop an antitrust case for Libra - something it hasn't even created yet - with the European Union clearly desperate for things to regulate (you can only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_Regulation_(EC)_No._2257/94">regulate the curvature of a banana</a> once, after all):</p><blockquote><em>"European Union antitrust regulators are already probing Facebook Inc.’s two-month-old Libra digital currency project, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. The European Commission is "currently investigating potential anti-competitive behavior" related to the Libra Association amid concerns the proposed payment system would unfairly shut out rivals, the EU authority said in a questionnaire sent out earlier this month."</em></blockquote><p>For the sake of consumers everywhere I hope, as with the MySpace case, that these legal but mostly political assaults fall flat. While I much prefer paying for a product than being the product, most people seem quite happy with the current arrangement. If any Big Tech companies decided to piss enough of their users off they will quickly go the way of MySpace, Friendster, Bebo, OpenSocial, ConnectU, Tribe.net, Path, Yik Yak, Ello, Orkut, Google+ and Vine, i.e. into the social media void.</p><p>Yes, those were <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/why-these-social-networks-failed-so-badly/">all competitors of Facebook</a> that it managed to fend off, but only by offering a superior product. Let's face it, Facebook is the #1 social network not because it was first but because it got social media right and managed to turn a profit at the same time. Its acquisitions of WhatsApp and especially Instagram have helped, but those are not immune to market forces either. Sure, there are <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2018/when-apples-walls-came-down">network effects</a>, but those only go so far; if a competitor is good enough, people will switch.</p><p>As for the other two Big Tech targets, Amazon is only able to maintain its online market share of nearly 50% in the US (it's only responsible for ~5% of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-13/emarketer-cuts-estimate-of-amazon-s-u-s-online-market-share">total retail spending</a>) by offering people better value than its many, many competitors. It barely makes <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/21/20826405/amazons-profits-revenue-free-cash-flow-explained-charts">any money</a> on its retail activities due to its razor-thin margins, precisely the opposite of how a monopolist exploiting its "market power" is supposed to behave, i.e. by restricting output and charging higher prices.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/amazon-revenue-profit.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>As for Google, it is only the dominant search engine because it was the first to offer people a <em>quality</em> web search option (Google is literally now the verb for a web search) and maintain that quality over time. If Google slips and/or something people value more emerges, whether that be a higher quality search result or a more privacy-friendly option (e.g. DuckDuckGo), Google will fade away into obscurity.</p><p>Ultimately, antitrust regulation targeted at companies in a sector which is almost as far removed from what antitrust was designed to prevent will result in a worse outcome for consumers. As I have written <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/why-facebook-shouldnt-be-regulated">many times before</a>, regulating these firms as monopolies will risk <em>making them </em>monopolies. It assumes a static state of affairs and acts accordingly, when that could not be further from the truth.</p><h3 id="who-pays-the-tax-or-tariff-subsidy-costs-of-poor-regulation-">Who pays the tax (or tariff, subsidy, costs of poor regulation)?</h3><p>Consumers.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Economists like to point out, to many people's disdain, that there's no such thing as a free lunch. Even free things have a price, regardless of whether it's clearly visible, and every decision involves trade-offs, i.e. there are benefits and costs.</p><p>That's why well-intentioned regulations that have benefits may actually, on balance, cause harm. Privacy on the internet (or lack thereof) - often <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/dont-have-a-barr-of-it">misunderstood</a> by those criticising it - is an area prone to regulatory miscalculation, with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the most well-known example. It was designed to protect people's privacy in the wake of a serious of scandals involving the likes of Facebook and, without a doubt, has some benefits. After all, as privacy expert Bruce Schneier <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2018/11/surveillance_kills_f.html">wrote</a> back in 2018, privacy is important:</p><p><em>"People change their behavior when they live their lives under surveillance. They are less likely to speak freely and act individually. They self-censor. They become conformist. This is obviously true for government surveillance, but is true for corporate surveillance as well. We simply aren't as willing to be our individual selves when others are watching.</em><br><em>...</em><br><em>If there is no privacy, there will be pressure to change. Some people will recognize that their morality isn't necessarily the morality of everyone—and that that's okay. But others will start demanding legislative change, or using less legal and more violent means, to force others to match their idea of morality.</em><br><br><em>It's easy to imagine the more conservative (in the small-c sense, not in the sense of the named political party) among us getting enough power to make illegal what they would otherwise be forced to witness. In this way, privacy helps protect the rights of the minority from the tyranny of the majority.</em><br><em>...</em><br><em>Privacy makes all of this possible. Privacy encourages social progress by giving the few room to experiment free from the watchful eye of the many. Even if you are not personally chilled by ubiquitous surveillance, the society you live in is, and the personal costs are unequivocal."</em></p><p>I'm all for privacy and exposing firms and governments which try to undermine it. But I have a problem with large, one-size-fits-all privacy regulations such as the GDPR, which add enormous compliance costs to virtually <em>everyone</em>. For while the GDPR helps to protect people's privacy online, it also has plenty of costs. For example, it erodes competition as smaller firms - especially those just starting up - are forced to divert valuable resources away from say engineers towards lobbyists, accountants and lawyers. Given the compliance costs, the GDPR tends to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-14/facebook-and-google-aren-t-hurt-by-gdpr-but-smaller-firms-are">help large, established firms</a> secure their place at the top in exchange for less disruptive competition and innovation. Such costs tend to continue to accumulate unseen for many years as innovation, and subsequently productivity growth, are artificially reduced.</p><p>Thankfully there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/09/preclusio-uses-machine-learning-to-comply-with-gdpr-other-privacy-regulations/">solutions</a> emerging that look to reduce those costs:</p><p><em>"As privacy regulations like GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act proliferate, more startups are looking to help companies comply. Enter Preclusio, a member of the Y Combinator Summer 2019 class, which has developed a machine learning-fueled solution to help companies adhere to these privacy regulations."</em></p><p>Will companies such as Preclusio be successful? Perhaps. But much like countries with tax codes that require a university course to comprehend, everyone would be better of with a simple set of rules rather than a good tax accountant. In other words, to fully capture the benefits of privacy that Schneier outlined above, it needs to be protected but in a far less costly manner than the likes of the GDPR, which has created an even worse outcome.</p><h3 id="another-90-days">Another 90 days</h3><p>Is Huawei a national security threat or not? Are American tariffs paid by American consumers or not? For Trump, logical consistency clearly doesn't matter, as last week he delayed tariffs leading up to Christmas (to prevent higher prices for US consumers) and extended the exemption of sanctions on Huawei by another 90 days. Neither decision fits the previous rhetoric, which as I have pointed out many times is an absolute bunch of crock.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3023242/huawei-said-win-another-90-days-reprieve-buy-american-suppliers">Huawei wins another 90 days reprieve to buy from American suppliers</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/15/japan-surpasses-china-as-largest-foreign-holder-of-us-treasurys.html">Japan surpasses China as largest foreign holder of US Treasurys</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.rt.com/business/466645-huawei-google-maps-rival/">Huawei to unveil its own mapping service to challenge Google Maps</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/the-world-s-gadget-makers-are-splitting-along-u-s-chinese-lines">Trump Tumult Has Gadget Giants Splitting Along US-China Lines</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-bluetooth/apples-airpods-will-not-escape-trumps-china-tariffs-idUSKCN1V31LD">Apple's AirPods will not escape Trump's China tariffs</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-18/trump-says-apple-s-cook-concerned-about-losing-edge-to-samsung">Trump Says Apple’s Cook Concerned About Losing Edge to Samsung With Tariffs</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="artificial-intelligence-isn-t-all-that-artificial">Artificial intelligence isn't all that artificial</h3><p>Behind every good algorithm is an army of humans.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Huawei has a plan and it's... Harmony, with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/09/huawei-harmony-os-hongmeng-android/">capital H</a>:</p><blockquote><em>"Huawei's long-rumored Android alternative, Hongmeng, is finally official. At today's Huawei Developer Conference, the company's Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu surprised the audience by unveiling "HarmonyOS," which he says is faster and safer than Android. Yu says that when Huawei can no longer access Google's Android ecosystem, the company can deploy HarmonyOS "at any time." Until then, Huawei will continue to support Android.</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><em>Yu's presentation was rather technical but in a nutshell, HarmonyOS is positioned as a future-proof, "microkernel-based, distributed OS for all scenarios." The platform is open source, and it's actually more of a competitor to Google's upcoming Fuchsia, given that both are microkernel-based and can be used on multiple types of devices at once. In his on-stage presentation he said that Android isn't as efficient due to its redundant codes, outdated scheduling mechanism and general fragmentation issues. Shots fired."</em></blockquote><p>The United States has it out for Huawei (see the <strong>The bits</strong> below) so this move was inevitable, as what good is a smartphone without a modern operating system? Huawei had to do something and while option A is no doubt to continue using its own launcher on Google's Android, it really, really needed a backup plan.</p><p>What surprised me was not the announcement of HarmonyOS, essentially a not-so-subtle re-branding of "Hongmeng", Huawei's long-rumoured operating system, but that is has been in the works since 2017. As Yu alluded to, "Hongmeng" was likely an operating system designed solely for the internet of things (e.g. speakers, vehicles, watches, fridges), not smartphones. The trade war probably forced Huawei into making it smartphone compatible far sooner than it had intended (if it had ever intended to make the pivot), so that if/when the United States forbids Google from trading with Huawei, it has something it can use on its phones. Huawei is, after all, a hardware company (at least for now).</p><p>My thoughts are that in the short term, HarmonyOS is a negative for Huawei: it's an investment it otherwise wouldn't have made given the choice, which is a decent test of whether a company believes an investment is beneficial or not. But it's definitely a positive for consumers. Why? Huawei's move into the mobile operating system space creates some much-needed competition to the duopoly that is iOS/Android. Better still Huawei is going to make it open source, so even if it fails the scraps can be used in other projects.</p><p>In the longer term, HarmonyOS may even work out for Huawei, provided it isn't completely awful. The mobile operating space is not an easy nut to crack, as Samsung found out with its failed attempt at a mobile operating system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen">Tizen</a>, as did Microsoft with its Windows Phone.</p><h3 id="it-s-good-to-have-a-backup-plan">It's good to have a backup plan</h3><p>Huawei cannot get HarmonyOS out the door soon enough if the "progress" in China's dispute with the United States is anything to go by. First step, a smart TV, which as noted above was probably the original plan anyway. The big test will come when it has to roll it out to mobile phones.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/09/trump-says-us-is-not-going-to-do-business-with-huawei-not-ready-to-make-a-trade-deal-with-china.html">Trump says US government won’t do business with Huawei, not ready to make a trade deal</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-08/u-s-holds-off-on-huawei-licenses-as-china-halts-crop-buying">U.S. Holds Off on Huawei Licenses as China Halts Crop-Buying</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-vision-tv-huawei-harmony-os/">Honor Vision smart TV is the first device with Huawei’s Harmony OS</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-china-analysis/promotions-and-patriotism-battle-mode-huawei-sees-china-smartphone-sales-surge-idUSKCN1UV0VO">Promotions and patriotism: 'Battle Mode' Huawei sees China smartphone sales surge</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="at-what-point-does-profit-become-important">At what point does profit become important?</h3><p>Note to Silicon Valley: a billion-dollar valuation might buy you time but it doesn't guarantee your survival.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/netflix-at-a-crossroads-hollywoods-dominant-disrupter-adjusts-growing-pains-1229618">Netflix Under Pressure: Can a Hollywood Disruptor Avoid Getting Disrupted?</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-lobbying-machine-inside-effort-sway-policy-worldwide-1229622">The Netflix Lobbying Machine: Inside the Effort to Sway Policy Worldwide</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/technology/uber-earnings.html">Uber Posts $5.2 Billion Loss and Slowest Ever Growth Rate</a> »</li><li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/uber-freezes-engineering-hires-amid-mounting-losses/">Uber, losing billions, freezes engineering hires</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-07/alphabet-s-deepmind-takes-on-billion-dollar-debt-as-loss-spirals">Alphabet’s DeepMind Takes on Billion-Dollar Debt</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="a-good-use-case-for-machine-learning">A good use-case for machine learning</h3><p>Regulations, once passed, are static.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apologies for the horrible pun in the title but it'll make sense if you keep reading. Also please note that I'm currently in the process of moving so there may not be an issue next week.</p><p>As you may have guessed, the title for this issue is a play on US Attorney General William Barr's name. But before I get into that, let's turn the clock back a bit. Remember when Australia tried to <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2018/australias-encryption-gamble">ban encryption</a>, with Australian businesses still <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/mozilla-internet-villain">paying the price</a> (and as you'll see in <strong>The Bits</strong> below, it could yet get worse)? </p><p>Well the United States, via a William Barr speech, has effectively announced its intention to do something similar, and it's a true "hold my beer" moment. He basically argued that consumers shouldn't be allowed encryption because he doesn't understand encryption and... society.</p><p>Barr also singled out Australia and the United Kingdom alongside two other well-known protectors of free speech, China and Russia, as examples of countries "addressing the issue" of encryption. Here is a snippet from the speech but do read the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-keynote-address-international-conference-cyber">whole thing</a>, although at 4,143 words of government double-speak your time would almost certainly be better spent doing just about anything else:</p><p><em>"In the digital age, the bulk of evidence is becoming digital, this form of “warrant proof” encryption poses a grave threat to public safety by extinguishing the ability of law enforcement to obtain evidence essential to detecting and investigating crimes. It allows criminals to operate with impunity, hiding their activities under an impenetrable cloak of secrecy. As you know, some refer to this eclipsing of the Government’s investigative capabilities as “going dark.” While encryption protects against cyberattacks, deploying it in warrant-proof form jeopardizes public safety more generally. The net effect is to reduce the overall security of society.... </em><br><br><em>At conferences like this, we talk about those costs in abstract terms. They are not abstract; they are real. The costs of irresponsible encryption that blocks legitimate law enforcement access is ultimately measured in a mounting number of victims — men, women, and children who are the victims of crimes — crimes that could have been prevented if law enforcement had been given lawful access to encrypted evidence."</em></p><p>I'm going to be a bit lazy here and show an image Rob Graham <a href="https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/1153736516449046528/photo/1">posted</a> in response to the speech, namely that crime has not noticeably increased since law enforcement "went dark" with the mainstreaming of encryption.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/crime-rates.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Then there's this doozy:</p><p><em>"Particularly with respect to encryption marketed to consumers, the significance of the risk should be assessed based on its practical effect on consumer cybersecurity, as well as its relation to the net risks that offering the product poses for society. After all, we are not talking about protecting the Nation’s nuclear launch codes. Nor are we necessarily talking about the customized encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, e-mail, and voice and data applications."</em></p><p>Customised encryption? No one uses customised encryption; there's proper encryption, and there's no encryption. How it's implemented might vary but encryption - whether it's the AES, ECC or RSA standard - <strong>is encryption</strong>.</p><p>Like Australia's former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/07/prime-minister-says-the-laws-of-australia-can-beat-the-laws-of-math/">once quipped</a> that while "the laws of mathematics are very commendable... the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia", Barr is out of his depth here. And that's a problem given he, or more likely his also out of depth advisors, are going to be drafting some form of legislation to "address the issue" of encryption.</p><p>Almost all of the data breaches that are reported here every week relate, in some form or another, to an improper (or non-existent) implementation of encryption. Undermining it by weakening/backdooring encryption on consumer products and services would assist far more criminals than it would defeat.</p><h3 id="the-consequences-of-the-trade-war-roll-on">The consequences of the trade war roll on</h3><p>The US has a delegation in China for another round of negotiations but in the meantime, jobs will be lost.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-economy-chipmakers-exclusiv/exclusive-bearing-brunt-of-trade-war-singapore-chipmakers-cut-jobs-idUSKCN1UJ0PW">Bearing brunt of trade war, Singapore chipmakers cut jobs</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/trump-says-apple-will-not-be-given-tariff-waivers-or-relief-for-mac-pro-parts-made-in-china.html">Trump says Apple will not be given tariff waivers/relief for Mac Pro parts made in China</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-26/trump-threatens-france-with-reciprocal-action-for-digital-tax">Trump Said He ‘Might’ Tariff French Wine as Digital Tax Reprisal</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="a-number-of-privacy-articles-in-the-news-this-week">A number of privacy articles in the news this week</h3><p>Medical records for scientific research?

Given the publicity the yield curve has received, I hope that both businesses and consumers are prudent. The ideal situation is that growth slows and we dodge an official recession – or the recession is mild. This is sometimes called the ‘soft-landing’ scenario. What we want to avoid is a replay of a hard landing associated with the 2008 global financial crisis."</em></p><p>The US tax cut fiscal stimulus will be wearing off soon and start detracting from growth in the coming quarters. There's every chance the yield curve is again proven correct, with a recession in 2020-21 (although as Harvey notes, it doesn't necessarily have to be a hard landing).</p><h2 id="this-week-s-data-breaches">This week's data breaches</h2><p>IBM Security released its annual study last week, the <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-07-23-IBM-Study-Shows-Data-Breach-Costs-on-the-Rise-Financial-Impact-Felt-for-Years" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cost of a Data Breach Report</a>, to estimate both the immediate and ongoing expense of a data breach.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After two days of Congressional hearings last week it is clear that, Libra - Facebook's forthcoming cryptocurrency - is intensely disliked by the establishment. Take the following headlines:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/fear-of-facebook-s-libra-unites-finance-chiefs-at-fractious-g-7-20190718-p52899.html">Fear of Facebook's Libra unites finance chiefs at fractious G-7.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-15/mnuchin-plans-briefing-on-cryptocurrency-regulatory-issues">Facebook’s Crypto Woes Deepen as Mnuchin Joins Parade of Critics.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-17/facebook-s-crypto-annoys-everyone">Facebook’s Crypto Annoys Everyone.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebooks-libra-could-be-more-dangerous-than-911-congressman-says-2019-07-17">Facebook’s Libra could be more dangerous than 9/11, congressman says.</a></li></ul><p>As a result, Facebook is "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/facebook-is-backpedaling-from-its-ambitious-vision-for-libra/">backpedaling from its ambitious vision for Libra</a>", moving away from the lofty goals set out in its white paper towards something more closely resembling a conventional financial network. It certainly didn't help that Facebook failed to do even a modicum of homework such as, oh I don't know, actually getting in touch with the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/fdpic-says-facebook-has-not-contacted-about-libra-data-protections.html">Swiss agency</a> that will supposedly be governing the crypto.</p><p>It's a shame, really, because most of the claims used to attack Libra are completely unfounded yet Facebook is folding like a cheap suit. In a three-part series on Libra, Diego Zuluaga of the Alt-M blog delves into how the critics' line of thinking is fundamentally flawed (do read the <a href="https://www.alt-m.org/2019/07/11/of-libras-and-zebras-part-one/">whole series</a>). Some excerpts:</p><p><strong>On systemic risk</strong></p><blockquote><em>"...a massive redemption caused by factors unique to Libra would not seem enough to cause a wider systemic crisis. Things might turn out differently if the Libra Association went back on its commitment to purchase stable assets on a one-for-one basis for every unit of Libra it issued. However, the prospect of a rapid loss of confidence in Libra as a result of such a turnabout, and the potential for customer lawsuits, provide strong disincentives against the Libra Association’s reneging on its promise of full backing. Still, given the commitments that the Libra Association has made so far, the grounds for expecting Libra to present a new systemic risk are lacking."</em></blockquote><p><strong>On monopolisation</strong></p><blockquote><em>"Networks are fragile things. A miscalculated governance change, such as a fee increase or a decrease in processing speed, can rapidly cause users to leave the network in favor of alternatives. This potential for rapid unraveling acts as a spur for networks to remain competitive and refrain from abusing customers. In Libra’s case, many potential rivals are members of the network and would see business flow to them directly if Libra reneged on its promise of cheap payments and transparency. Some of these latent competitors are billion-dollar businesses processing trillions of dollars’ worth of transactions every year, so one should not dismiss out of hand their ability to compete with Libra.</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><em>Even if Facebook did manage to gain control over the governance of Libra, Mastercard, Paypal, and Visa will still run their own payments applications. Furthermore, Libra will face different competitors in different markets. For domestic payments, the card networks, Venmo, Paypal, and Zelle (the banks’ Venmo) come to mind. In international payments, Transferwise has quickly become a successful cost-cutter by matching foreign-exchange transactions, whereas Ripple promises to use cryptocurrency technology to cut the cost of cross-border money transfers. To these one must add the incumbent remittance providers, such as Western Union and Ria."</em></blockquote><p><strong>On facilitating crime</strong></p><blockquote><em>"...the anecdotal evidence overstates the degree to which cryptocurrencies facilitate crime. While the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions disguises the identity of the people involved, most cryptocurrencies are a poor instrument for nefarious activities. This is because the transaction ledger, the blockchain, is publicly accessible and includes information about the origin and destination of cryptocurrency payments. Firms like Chainalysis (whose co-founder the Times article cited) and Elliptic have in fact made it their business to pore through blockchains on behalf of clients, including the U.S. government, to combat fraud and aid the pursuit of crime.</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><em>Both resellers and validators will act as intermediaries and be subject to prudential and consumer protection rules. Furthermore, digital wallet providers – who will support the applications people use to make and receive Libra payments – will collect personal information from Libra users to comply with regulations against money-laundering and financial crime in the jurisdictions where the user lives. For example, Calibra, Facebook’s own digital wallet subsidiary, has registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) at the U.S. Treasury. Calibra also holds eight state money transmitter licenses as of July 16. From Marcus’ testimony, it seems Calibra would like to have licenses in all U.S. jurisdictions – states and territories – before Libra launches in 2020. Marcus also stated the Libra Association will register with FinCEN, despite being a Swiss-based foundation."</em></blockquote><p>I wanted Libra to succeed but Facebook is doing its darnedest to mess the whole thing up. The accusations being thrown at the yet-to-be-released stablecoin have very little weight to them, yet Facebook is ceding valuable ground to every single one. Perhaps that <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-13/facebook-5-billion-dollar-fine-cambridge-analytica-privacy/11306324">5-billion dollar fine</a> really did shake things up and Facebook has lost what disruptive touch it once had, with Libra all but destined for the cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockchain-finance-focus/wall-street-finds-blockchain-hard-to-tame-after-early-euphoria-idUSKCN1UB0YV">scrapheap</a>.</p><h3 id="slacking-off-on-security">Slacking off on security</h3><p>The biggest waste of time that for some reason - unbeknownst to me - people still use, does not have the best security track record.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the United Kingdom's Internet Services Providers’ Association (ISPA), a Trade Association lobby group, <a href="https://www.ispa.org.uk/ispa-announces-finalists-for-2019-internet-heroes-and-villains-trump-and-mozilla-lead-the-way-as-villain-nominees/">released</a> its finalists for internet 'hero' and 'villain' of the year, listing Mozilla - creator of the Firefox web browser - as one of three finalists in the villain category. After some serious backlash, it subsequently <a href="https://www.ispa.org.uk/ispa-withdraws-mozilla-internet-villain-nomination-and-category/">withdrew</a> both Mozilla's nomination and the villain category altogether.</p><p>Let's take a quick look at why Mozilla, "a non-profit organization that promotes openness, innovation and participation on the Internet", might have been nominated. But first, the other contenders.</p><p>Joining Mozilla as finalists for internet villain of the year was the European Union's Article 13 Copyright Directive, "for threatening freedom of expression online", and President Donald Trump, "for causing a huge amount of uncertainty across the complex, global telecommunications supply chain in the course of trying to protect national security".</p><p>I actually took little issue with those two, which are both deserving for the reasons cited, although I might have nominated Peter Dutton for Australia's ill-conceived encryption bill instead of the EU's Article 13. But Mozilla? It was listed because of its plan to allow Firefox to use DNS over HTTPS (DoH, a relatively new method to encrypt DNS requests directly in the browser):</p><blockquote><em>"...in such a way as to bypass UK filtering obligations and parental controls, undermining internet safety standards in the UK."</em></blockquote><p>Right. It might as well have rephrased that to:</p><blockquote><em>"...in such a way as to bypass the UK government's censorship and undermine our members' ability to monetise consumer browsing activity."</em></blockquote><p>For those unaware, DNS requests are the last bastion of the old internet yet to undergo a cryptographic revolution. DNS requests - that is, requests to a public directory that translates domain names (e.g. econbyte.com) into corresponding IP addresses (e.g. 123.123.123.123) - are sent in plain text and so can be used by internet service providers to monitor people's browsing history.</p><p>This can happen even if you're using a VPN (as shown in this <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-identify-and-prevent-dns-leaks-5fa659130a41">image</a>) unless you've manually changed your DNS server or enabled what is called "DNS leak protection", which routes all DNS queries to the provider through the encrypted VPN tunnel.</p><p>As you might expect, the whole plain-text DNS data collection process can be quite lucrative to ISPs when that data are on-sold to advertisers or any other organisation that might be interested in people's digital footprints.</p><p>Work to fix the DNS privacy hole has been under way for some time. For example, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-tls/">Cloudflare</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-tls">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.quad9.net/private-dns-quad9-android9/">Quad9</a> have all been pushing for DNS over TLS (DoT), a similar technology to DoH but one which uses its own unique port, 853. </p><p>However, the advantage of DoH is that requests are effectively buried in the rest of the internet's encrypted traffic on port 443, making it indistinguishable from the vast majority of data that flow across the internet every day. This is how many VPNs operate in places such as China, where conventional VPN ports are blocked as part of its "great firewall". Without DNS leaks and with everything funnelled through port 443, the only way to censor people would be to effectively turn the internet off (and yes, that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/08/28/the-countries-shutting-down-the-internet-the-most-infographic/">happens more than you think</a>). Being able to properly encrypt data, including something as seemingly simple as browsing history, can literally be a matter of life and death <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression_of_cyber-dissidents">for some people</a>.</p><p>Essentially Mozilla should be praised, not condemned, for trying to improve privacy on the internet by allowing people to enable DoH directly in their browser. The real villains are those such as the ISPA and its political lackeys, whose constant attacks on encryption are nothing but a blatant attempt by lobbyists to keep the gravy train flowing, all under the opaque guise of national security (kudos to UK provider Andrews &amp; Arnold for <a href="https://twitter.com/aaisp/status/1146803916853645314">donating</a> the equivalent of an ISPA membership fee to Mozilla).</p><p>Mozilla's Firefox 68 was <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/07/09/changes-in-firefox-68/">released last week</a>. If you use Chrome or one of Microsoft's god-awful browsers, consider giving it a whirl. You can enable DoH by going to Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Network Settings -&gt; Enable DNS over HTTPS.</p><h3 id="google-s-creepiness">Google's creepiness</h3><p>What a week for Google. First it was revealed that, like Amazon, the things Google Home devices record are listened to by humans (as I've said many times, that's how "artificial intelligence" - as the term is being improperly used, anyway - works). Worse, it was recording private conversations without first being "triggered" by the user.</p><p>Then we have more "business as usual" news, such as Google making your private photos semi-public and oh yeah, it's also "helping China’s authoritarian government conduct mass surveillance against its citizens".

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh no, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/trump-officials-weigh-encryption-crackdown-1385306">here we go again</a>:</p><blockquote><em>"Senior Trump administration officials met on Wednesday to discuss whether to seek legislation prohibiting tech companies from using forms of encryption that law enforcement can’t break — a provocative step that would reopen a long-running feud between federal authorities and Silicon Valley.</em></blockquote><p>Sigh, what a horrible idea. The 'bad guys' will encrypt their communication regardless of the legality and any encryption that's breakable by law enforcement is also breakable by the 'bad guys'. Remember when Australia effectively banned encryption by requiring companies to backdoor their software when requested by the government? Well that law <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/663711/government-acknowledges-aussie-business-taken-hit-from-encryption-law/">has</a>, as <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2018/australias-encryption-gamble">predicted</a>, "had a material impact on the Australian market and the ability for Australian companies to compete globally".</p><p>It was also what allowed the Australian Federal Police to <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/afp-emails-shed-new-light-on-media-investigations-show-officers-were-armed-during-raids-20190705-p524kc.html">controversially</a> raid the ABC in June, with this gem buried away in Schedule 3, enabling officers <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/huge-scope-of-australias-new-national-security-laws-reveals-itself/">to use</a>:</p><blockquote><em>"...any other computer or a communication in transit to access the relevant data", and "if necessary achieve that purpose -- to add, copy, delete or alter other data", provided that "having regard to other methods (if any) of obtaining access to the relevant data which are likely to be as effective, it is reasonable in all the circumstances to do so".</em></blockquote><p>Unintended or deliberate consequences? This is legislation that was rushed through Parliament - with the full support of the opposition - before Christmas, apparently to thwart some undisclosed threat, and now Australian businesses and journalists are paying the price. While politicians assure us that the bill has resulted in "lives being saved", the Minister of Home Affairs <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/encryption-laws-are-creating-an-exodus-of-data-from-australia-vault/">censors the Ombudsman's reports</a>, meaning we will never really know. Not that they would care, anyway, as politicians are <a href="https://www.itwire.com/government-tech-policy/86417-only-politicians-get-exemption-from-encryption-law.html">the only people</a> exempt from the anti-encryption law.</p><p>However, not everyone is as dismissive of cost-benefit analysis as Australia. In the United States, there at least appears to be something resembling debate within government, with various departments unsure as to whether or not banning/weakening encryption would be a good idea (bravo, Commerce and State Departments!).</p><blockquote><em>"The DOJ and the FBI argue that catching criminals and terrorists should be the top priority, even if watered-down encryption creates hacking risks. The Commerce and State Departments disagree, pointing to the economic, security and diplomatic consequences of mandating encryption “backdoors.”</em><br><br><em>DHS is internally divided. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency knows the importance of encrypting sensitive data, especially in critical infrastructure operations, but ICE and the Secret Service regularly run into encryption roadblocks during their investigations."</em></blockquote><p>Hopefully cooler heads prevail. After all, it was only last week that the United States <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20679998/trump-huawei-trade-announcement-restrictions">conceded</a> that banning Huawei in the name of national security... might actually compromise national security (see below for more on that debacle). Now it wants to ban encryption for the same reason, despite ample evidence showing that doing so would actually weaken national security? What a joke.</p><h3 id="the-real-motivation-for-the-huawei-ban-">The real motivation for the Huawei ban.</h3><p>It turns out that the reason the United States is so far behind in the 5G race is because "the broadband spectrum needed to create a successful network was reserved not for commercial purposes but for the military", making it "significantly slower and more expensive to roll out than just about anywhere else".</p><p>The Pentagon, which is leading the push against Huawei and other "national security" threats that also happen to be 5G pioneers, is the reason why the US sucks at 5G.

The files authorities are looking for include Islamic extremist content, but also innocuous Islamic material, academic books on Islam by leading researchers, and even music from a Japanese metal band."</em></blockquote><p>Not a good precedent.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who doesn't love email? Likely a lot of you, but probably because of what you receive through it (or how you manage your inbox) rather than the protocol itself. Email - or rather, the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) - is good at what it does. It lets anyone, anywhere, to send and receive messages regardless of what device or email application they happen to use. In that sense email is federated, distributed and decentralised in that it allows multiple small networks to talk to one another without giving up control.<br></p><p>Google is responsible for a large portion of email traffic through its aptly-named email service, Gmail. It has more than a billion users and as this graphic from <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17570/most-popular-email-clients/">Statista</a> indicates, is neck and neck with Apple's default mail application in terms of usage:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/email-client-popularity-april-2019-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>But Google wants to capture more than mere market share; it wants to combine static with dynamic. Essentially, the "do no evil" company wants to take SMTP and modernise it using its own protocol, Accelerated Mobile Pages (<a href="https://amp.dev/">AMP</a>), which essentially allows applications/websites to run inside emails. If you use Gmail, you're <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail/">already</a> using AMP.</p><p>The big question is: why? Email is mature, simple and <em>it just works</em>. If you wanted something more than a reliable, static email message to solve your organisation's communication needs, then use something like Slack (although you <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/slacking-off">shouldn't</a>).</p><p>The answer is that it makes sense for Google. Its chat/email-alternative, "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-hangouts-g-suite-shutdown-october/">Hangouts</a>", officially failed earlier this year. So it wants to further monetise email, a medium where it already has more than a quarter of the world's users. It has struggled on that front so far because given the federated, decentralised and distributed nature of email, it can only monetise it by using the data it collects from Gmail users (plus their correspondents) and through adverts shown in desktop users' inboxes. But it can't do anything with the email itself.</p><p>That's where AMP shakes things up. With AMP, Google can do oh so much more with a boring email. By turning email into an "interactive, dynamic" medium, it can run advertising anywhere it wants, auto-play videos, and track every single way you interact with any part of the email, all directly from your and your correspondents' inbox (and via any other service foolish enough to sign up to AMP). It's even able to display dynamic website content, after it strips it of competitors' branding, trackers and advertising, of course.</p><p>Just like that, Google controls even more of what we can see and do on the internet. First it <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/e2email-research-project-has-left-nest_24.html">killed off</a> its end-to-end encryption project which would have done the opposite of AMP, i.e. help make email private and secure, and now it wants to ruin email altogether.</p><p>But you don't have to be a pawn in Google's latest evil scheme. I ditched Gmail several years ago and more people should do the same (see my recommendations below). An internet where everything is filtered through Google is one in which I do not want to take part, and you shouldn't either.</p><h3 id="some-alternatives-to-gmail">Some alternatives to Gmail</h3><p>It would be lazy of me not to suggest a few alternatives to Gmail given that I just sledged it above. Any of the mainstream providers - Microsoft's Office 365, Apple Mail - are better than Gmail, but only slightly.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week Facebook confirmed the worst kept secret in the tech world and announced its new cryptocurrency, Libra. You can read the full white paper <a href="https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/">here</a>, or bear with me as I attempt to break it down.</p><p>You might think that given how critical I have been of Facebook in the past, this post would involve me tearing it to shreds. But if you did, you'd be wrong; I actually kind of like Libra, with a number of caveats of course. Really, it's about time one of Silicon Valley's unicorns decided to take on the banking sector and the legions that suckle its sweet, sweet nectar. I had hoped that Apple's earlier <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/apple-the-banker">foray into banking</a> would have involved blockchain, but alas it opted for a lousy credit card (a classic Apple not-so-innovative "innovation").</p><p><strong>What is Libra?</strong></p><p>Libra is essentially what has been dubbed a 'stablecoin', in that it's pegged - linked - to the value of a particular fiat currency. In Libra's case, it will actually be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies, much like a special drawing rights (SDR) facility. Although unlike an SDR, Libra will be 100% backed by a reserve of low-volatility assets. That means that every Libra coin ever created will be backed by a real, "safe" asset (US Treasuries, for example). The <a href="https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/#the-libra-currency-and-reserve">white paper</a> even references the gold standard, under which many fiat currencies used to be based:</p><blockquote>"Libra is designed to be a stable digital cryptocurrency that will be fully backed by a reserve of real assets — the Libra Reserve — and supported by a competitive network of exchanges buying and selling Libra. That means anyone with Libra has a high degree of assurance they can convert their digital currency into local fiat currency based on an exchange rate, just like exchanging one currency for another when travelling. This approach is similar to how other currencies were introduced in the past: to help instil trust in a new currency and gain widespread adoption during its infancy, it was guaranteed that a country’s notes could be traded in for real assets, such as gold. Instead of backing Libra with gold, though, it will be backed by a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks."</blockquote><p>It makes sense that Facebook would want a stablecoin, as it removes a major problem faced by cryptocurrencies that purport to be a medium of exchange: that prices can be relatively easily distorted by speculators, making them more akin to assets than currencies.</p><p>There is also none of the excessive computation required by proof-of-work cryptos such as Bitcoin (although the Lightning Network helps solve that), with dozens of "validators" (28, initially) operating the proprietary Libra network. In that sense, Libra's blockchain looks a lot like a delegated proof-of-stake network, more akin to say EOS than Bitcoin. It's not decentralised and it's not permissionless, and although the white paper states that "an important objective of the Libra Association is to move toward increasing decentralization over time", we all know Facebook well enough by now not to be fooled by that.</p><p><strong>Overcoming the vested interests</strong></p><p>In terms of what Libra means for the status quo, the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://archive.fo/B93BA">provided</a> a helpful infographic that shows how Libra might disrupt the traditional payments system:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/ft-libra-model.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>While there's nothing <em>new</em> about Libra from a technological point of view, Facebook has something its competitors can only dream of: over 2 billion users already on its network, first mover advantage and an army of lawyers that may just be able to convince regulators to let it happen (or bypass them altogether).</p><p>That will be important, as the establishment was quick to react to the latest threat to its gravy train. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, for instance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-boe-carney-facebook/central-banks-will-want-oversight-of-facebooks-libra-bank-of-englands-carney-idUSKCN1TM0RW">noted</a> that for him to accept Libra "we, the Fed, all the major global central banks and supervisors, would have direct regulatory [oversight of Libra]." The United States Senate has already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-crypto-senate/senate-panel-to-examine-facebook-digital-currency-project-idUSKCN1TK2SX">called</a> Facebook to a panel that "will explore the project". France’s finance minister <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-crypto/facebook-reveals-libra-cryptocurrency-sparking-new-privacy-concerns-idUSKCN1TJ0TN">said</a> he had asked central bank heads from G7 countries to write a report on the project by the middle of July.</p><p>Importantly, not a single bank has signed up to be a part of Libra so you can be sure that they, their political allies (large recipients of financial sector donations) and their central bank enablers will fight it tooth and nail. These stakeholders are far more powerful than the taxi lobby, so Facebook will have a mighty fight on its hands.</p><p><strong>Monetising Libra</strong></p><p>The final question is if Facebook can get past the vested interests, how will it monetise this thing? A clue was provided in the form of the simultaneous announcement of a purpose-built wallet - "Calibra" - within which users may store funds and conduct transactions. This, and presumably plenty of other services it (and others) will build on top of the Libra network, is where Facebook will collect user data to monetise.</p><p>While the technology underpinning the Libra network will be open source and its governance ceded to the Switzerland-based "Libra Association", Facebook's apps will work better than its competitors' apps (at least initially, when there may not even be any competing apps given that Facebook has invented its own programming language for smart contracts on the network, "Move"), meaning that to use the network you're going to need to consent to Facebook's terms.</p><p>For an example of the network effect, take Facebook Messenger. More than a billion people use that app despite it being inferior to many competitors, and that's a mature space these days and Facebook was by no means a first mover. That means Calibra, the first payment app available on its very own purpose-built network with its own coding language will almost certainly capture enormous market share, dominating the Libra financial transaction space indefinitely.</p><p><strong>The future is bright</strong></p><p>To be clear, I had hoped for virtually any company other than Facebook to have made this move (Amazon is amazingly placed to compete in this space). However, if any company was going to successfully take crypto mainstream and disrupt the financial sector - to break the ice for better alternatives down the road - Facebook's size and reach leave it as well placed as any. I like Libra not for Libra itself, but for the new markets that it will enable in the not-so-distant future. Good luck, Zuck.</p><h3 id="this-is-why-facebook-must-succeed">This is why Facebook must succeed</h3><p>From the article linked below:</p><blockquote>"The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street’s self-regulatory organization (SRO), has sat for months on some 40 applications from companies that touch cryptocurrencies, numerous people who deal with the agency told CoinDesk."</blockquote><p>What those applicants don't have is size and influence, something Facebook has in spades. It's easy for regulators to stonewall small players, but good luck doing that to Facebook. I probably won't use Libra but I'm excited by what it will enable and the inefficiencies it will relegate to the history books.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/stonewalled-by-finra-up-to-40-crypto-securities-wait-in-limbo-for-launch">Stonewalled by FINRA, Up to 40 Crypto Securities Wait in Limbo for Launch</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="where-to-now-for-china">Where to now for China</h3><p>Huawei is on the naughty list, but for how long?

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A question for you: have you read a privacy policy in the past year? If you answered yes, you're probably in the minority. For while important, privacy policies tend to be long-winded, lawyer-written junk that you have to accept to proceed anyway. Why bother?</p><p>Alas, I actually do read privacy policies, even though I accept the vast majority despite wishing they were less invasive. In my experience, other than the uniformly long length, the one consistency amongst privacy policies seems to be that they involve giving up any and all rights to your personal information.Here's an example from a privacy policy I read last week as part of a survey I was asked to complete (the company will remain unnamed to protect its... privacy). It wanted to:</p><ul><li>Store my personal information, including name, email, address, date of birth, gender, country, IP address, relationships, education and "any other data we collect about you".</li><li>Send that information to the United States and Philippines.</li><li>Retain the data associated with my account indefinitely.</li><li>Share that data with third-party vendors "to enable them to perform services for us".</li><li>Disclose all data if required by law; if any part of the company is sold or transferred "in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, or other company change"; or "to our subsidiaries or affiliates if necessary for business and operational purposes".</li></ul><p>Basically a licence to do whatever it wants. I wasn't happy with that, so I decided to decline the terms and conditions but lo and behold, it wouldn't let me proceed. Go figure! Unfortunately in my case I didn't really have a choice, as the "request" to complete it was more akin to an "order", so I reluctantly accepted its terms, populated it with as much dummy personal information as possible and proceeded to the survey.</p><p>Now to the point: that experience happened to coincide with an article published by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> last week, which examined the privacy policies of just about all the major tech companies:</p><blockquote>"I analyzed the length and readability of privacy policies from nearly 150 popular websites and apps. Facebook’s privacy policy, for example, takes around 18 minutes to read in its entirety – slightly above average for the policies I tested... For comparison, here are the scores for some classic texts. Only Immanuel Kant’s famously difficult “Critique of Pure Reason” registers a more challenging readability score than Facebook’s privacy policy."</blockquote><p>What's the point of a privacy policy that takes 18 minutes to read and "exceed[s] the college reading level", to the extent that most Americans - let alone those for whom English may be a second language - would struggle to comprehend it? Two reasons: one, to confuse and obfuscate what the company actually does; and two, regulatory compliance.</p><p>Facebook mostly falls under the first category. It will "never sell your data", but it will happily give it all away to advertisers using its platform. Google? The second:</p><blockquote>"Google’s privacy policy... became more readable at the expense of brevity after the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation, the European Union data privacy protection framework that went into effect a year ago. The regulation includes a clause requiring privacy policies to be delivered in a 'concise, transparent and intelligible form, using clear and plain language.'"</blockquote><p>Well, at least people can read it now; they'll just need to set aside a few hours before registering that new Gmail account. Unfortunately, it could be about to get even worse, with layers of duplication coming thanks to privacy regulations being passed at multiple levels of government:</p><blockquote>"As data collection practices become more sophisticated (and invasive), it’s unlikely that privacy policies will become any easier to comprehend. And if states continue to draft their own data protection laws, as California is doing with its Consumer Privacy Act, privacy policies could balloon with location-specific addendums."</blockquote><p>Today's privacy policies - which may soon become even longer - are so large and so vague that they may as well be replaced with a single line saying "by signing up you agree to let us do whatever the hell we want with your personal information". It's a sad state of affairs but there are at least a few exceptions, with the best privacy policy I have seen (by far) coming courtesy of Google search rival <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">DuckDuckGo</a>. It reads:</p><blockquote>"DuckDuckGo does not collect or share personal information."</blockquote><p>Simple and to the point; the perfect privacy policy. Now that obviously wouldn't work for a company like Facebook, which derives most of its revenue from collecting and sharing personal information. But there's definitely room to improve and the internet would be a much better place with less lawyer speak and more concise, to-the-point privacy policies like DuckDuckGo's.</p><h3 id="facebook-s-new-cryptocurrency-libra">Facebook's new cryptocurrency: Libra</h3><p>Rumours have it that later today Facebook will announce its very own cryptocurrency, Libra (or the 'Libra Project', or 'GlobalCoin'). It has a consortium of companies lined up in support with a $10m minimum investment required. The list of investors is essentially a "who's who" of Silicon Valley venture capital, along with legacy fintech players such as MasterCard and Visa (see <em>Image of the week</em> below). With that kind of support and the network effects Facebook has in place, it doesn't even have to be the "best" option to pull this off (taking blockchain mainstream), although it hasn't been all smooth sailing and may still be a long way off:</p><p><em>"Sources attribute the delay to blockchain industry incumbents being reluctant to work on a project that doesn’t appear to have the hallmarks of a true cryptocurrency... [and] estimated that early 2020 would be a more realistic timeframe for testing, so any imminent announcements would merely be forward-looking plans."</em></p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/concerns-over-facebook-data-use-derailed-at-least-3-crypto-partnerships">Concerns Over Facebook Data Use Derailed at Least 3 Crypto Partnerships</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/06/14/facebooks-cryptocurrency-partners-revealed-we-obtained-the-entire-list-of-inaugural-backers/">Facebook’s cryptocurrency partners revealed—we obtained the entire list of inaugural backers</a> ($) »</li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-new-cryptocurrency-gets-big-backers-11560463312">Facebook’s New Cryptocurrency, Libra, Gets Big Backers</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="this-week-s-data-breaches">This week's data breaches</h3><p>Data breaches have become such a common occurrence that it's almost worth keeping this here as a permanent feature.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No, I don't mean Israel Folau's multi-million dollar <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-06/israel-folau-sues-rugby-australia-for-breach-of-contract/11185064">lawsuit</a> that could bankrupt Rugby Australia, but Google's <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/Google%20reportedly%20calls%20Huawei%20ban%20a%20US%20national%20security%20risk">fight</a> against the Huawei ban:</p><blockquote>"Google apparently has warned the Trump administration that its Huawei ban could endanger US national security. <br><br>The search giant's senior executives are pushing for an exemption from the Huawei blacklisting that basically banned US companies from doing business with the Chinese company. <br><br>They're worried that that the ban would stop them from updating Android on Huawei's phones, potentially prompting the company to develop its own version of the operating system, the report said. Huawei's Android alternative -- reportedly called "Hongmeng" -- would be easier to hack, the execs reckon."</blockquote><p>Oh don't you just hate those pesky unintended consequences. Not only will Trump's Huawei decision potentially threaten rather than improve national security, but it's also going to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-europe-gsma/europes-5g-to-cost-62-billion-more-if-chinese-vendors-banned-industry-idUSKCN1T80Y3">take a toll</a> on consumers' hip pockets:</p><blockquote>"A ban on buying telecoms equipment from Chinese firms would add about 55 billion euros ($62 billion) to the cost of 5G networks in Europe and delay the technology by about 18 months, according to an industry analysis seen by Reuters. <br><br>The 55-billion-euro estimate reflects the total additional costs implied by a full ban on purchases from Huawei and Chinese peer ZTE for the roll out of 5G networks in Europe. <br><br>The two Chinese vendors have a combined market share in the European Union of more than 40%."</blockquote><p>The number comes from an industry lobby group so should be taken with a heavy pinch of salt, but there's no doubt that the direction is correct: all else equal banning a major supplier will increase costs, despite Nokia denying the findings (expected given it's a major Huawei competitor in the 5G space).</p><p>But back to the lawyers, who apparently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/07/huawei-ban-threatens-us-national-security-tech-companies-warn-trump-administration/">devised a way</a> to circumvent the US "entity list" (which Huawei is now on) way back when the Obama administration was coming down hard on ZTE, another Chinese telco:</p><blockquote>"...the possibility was dreamed up in March, 2016, by Kevin Wolf, then the assistant secretary of state for export administration and now a partner in the law firm Akin Gump. <br><br>At the time, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security was planning to place another Chinese company, ZTE, on the entity list, and Wolf was contemplating the many repercussions of such a move. On his commute into Washington from Arlington one day, he decided it would be a good idea to give companies a workaround in the form of a license."</blockquote><p>Google currently has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18633171/huawei-software-updates-phones-google-android-commerce-department">90-day exemption</a> from the Huawei ban, allowing it to send software updates to its devices. What are the odds that its licence is eventually: (a) extended; or (b) expanded, similarly to the workaround devised by Kevin Wolf back in 2016?</p><p>For me it all depends on how long this saga continues. Remember, the ZTE case - which was eventually <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/07/us-to-settle-with-chinese-phone-maker-zte-for-1-billion-over-iran-sales.html">resolved</a> in just 3 months after a cheeky $US1 billion payment to the US government - rested on the company's dealings with Iran in direct violation of US sanctions.</p><p>But Huawei? As far as I'm aware the only charge is that it is "engaged in activities that are contrary to US national security or foreign policy interest". Yes, Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou is currently being detained in Canada over alleged Iranian sanction violations. And yes, the T-Mobile theft case has been dragged back into it (Huawei settled that civil lawsuit back in 2014). But other than those somewhat lightweight accusations (apologies to Meng), the US hasn't actually caught Huawei with its hand in the cookie jar, so to speak, so national security was cited and it was placed on the semi-naughty list instead (Huawei is on the "entity list", whereas ZTE was placed on the more severe "denied persons list").</p><p>Unfortunately for Huawei, the lack of a smoking gun means the case will be more difficult to resolve, as there's no charge that can be settled with the payment of a simple billion dollar fine. So it's no wonder Google's (and Huawei's) lawyers have been busy: unless the US and China can drum up some kind of trade deal that includes Huawei before 19 August (which is when Google's 90-day exemption expires), it's going to need exemptions or risk a major competitor to its Android ecosystem emerging in China.</p><p>While we wait for that to happen, consumers of technology (i.e. everyone) will wear the cost in the form of reduced competition, lower quality and higher prices. Although I hear you can get a pretty good deal on a Huawei phone these days.</p><h3 id="china-s-assembling-its-own-naughty-list">China's assembling its own naughty list</h3><p>China: I see your "entity list" and raise you an "unreliable list". Yes, China is creating its own list of undesirable companies, no doubt to be populated with the who's who of the NASDAQ. The reason is apparently to encourage US companies to "use lobbying to push back against the government’s moves". Makes sense to me, and it seems to be working already with Google and even Trump's acting budget chief asking for a delay in the restrictions against Huawei.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/business/economy/china-huawei-trump.html">China Summons Tech Giants to Warn Against Cooperating With Trump Ban</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-huawei/trump-acting-budget-chief-asks-for-delay-on-huawei-restrictions-idUSKCN1TA0T1">Trump acting budget chief asks for delay on Huawei restrictions</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="apple-s-999-monitor-stand">Apple's $999 monitor stand</h3><p>You read that correctly.

Understandably, it was mocked relentlessly.</p><p>In other Apple news, it unveiled a "find my phone" feature using encrypted Bluetooth signals. Basically, Apple can now track you any time you're within Bluetooth range of another Apple device. The company says even it doesn't have the encryption keys (you need two Apple devices to get it to work, each will hold a copy of the others' key), but it hasn't released any code or audit results to confirm that. So in other words, "trust us".

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have micropayments as a viable source of revenue on the internet finally arrived? Some people seem to think so:</p><blockquote>"The era of almost-everything-free-on-the-Internet may be evolving into the age of the micropayment with new software from IBM and Compaq, who are pushing for new Net standards to hurry things along."</blockquote><p>That quote is from <em>Wired,</em> not from its most recent articles but its <a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/11/toward-a-click-and-pay-standard/">1999 archives</a>. You see, the idea of micropayments as a method of compensating content creators for basically anything you can imagine has been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and now they're <a href="http://fortune.com/2019/05/26/kik-facebook-news-micropayments/">back again</a>:</p><blockquote>"It's a problem that’s long flummoxed media outlets, and also one that’s increasingly frustrating consumers: The inability to pay a small sum, such as 25 cents or $1, to read an article online. Yet a breakthrough could be near, as big web platforms like Facebook and Kik are building technology that could mean a new revenue stream for news outlets and an alternative to consumers having to hand over their credit card information to read a single story."</blockquote><p>Can Facebook (or Kik) solve a problem that has thwarted every large internet company going back at least as far as IBM's failed attempt in 1999? There's definitely scope for such a mechanism, as people really <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/advertising-major-source-human-dissatisfaction">hate adverts</a>:</p><blockquote>"We have found evidence of negative links between national advertising and national wellbeing. Using longitudinal information on countries, from pooled cross-sectional surveys, we find that rises and falls in advertising are followed, a few years later, by falls and rises in national life-satisfaction, giving an inverse connection between advertising levels and the later wellbeing levels of nations."</blockquote><p>But what do people hate more, adverts or paying for stuff? Even paying as little as a cent for a news article necessitates what Clay Shirky, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010203140700/http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.html">writing back in 2000</a>, called a "mental transaction cost", causing both "anxiety and confusion":</p><blockquote>"Thus the anxiety of buying is a permanent feature of micropayment systems, since economic decisions are made on the margin - not, "Is a drink worth a dollar?" but, "Is the next drink worth the next dollar?" Anything that requires the user to approve a transaction creates this anxiety, no matter what the mechanism for deciding or paying is."</blockquote><p>The technology for processing micropayments has been improving since they were conceived, with a number of recent examples using blockchain technology in an attempt to get micropayments to work. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-lightning-invoice-micropayments">Alex Bosworth</a>, for example, is using Bitcoin's lightning network to charge users a cent or two per article on his blog. A new platform, <a href="https://satoshipay.io/">SatoshiPay</a> promises "global, fast and easy micropayment solutions", again facilitated via the blockchain.</p><p>But while interesting, no one has yet found a way to get around "mental transaction costs", the ultimate bane of the micropayment model. People seem to be fine with monthly or annual subscriptions to an aggregation of content - Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Spotify, etc., all rely on this model to varying extents - but once you break it down further, it's just not worth people's time and effort to make the requisite number of decisions needed for such a system to survive.</p><p>Maybe Facebook will solve the problem of micropayments and in the process relieve us from the constant onslaught of advertising to which it, and others, subject us. More likely, micropayments will just form another piece of the constantly evolving Facebook revenue puzzle, for example instead of simply "liking" someone's post you'll be able to "tip" them using Facebook's "Globalcoin" currency.</p><p>Personally, I don't see such an implementation doing anything to disrupt the status quo, meaning the age of micropayments (as originally envisioned) is still as much of a pipe dream now as it was back in 1999.</p><h3 id="apple-privacy-friend">Apple, privacy friend</h3><p>Just joking. It turns out Apple lets apps use something called "background app refresh" to send tracking info like location and IP address, even late at night. Google is no better, though, and has gone ahead with its controversial plan to restrict ad-blockers on Chrome.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it concerns foreign threats, the "five eyes" of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and United States are paranoid about their respective national security. Fair enough, too; there's no doubt that the North Korean, Russian and Chinese governments (and probably plenty others) actively develop and maintain an assortment of potentially malicious tools designed to compromise "the West's" critical infrastructure.</p><p>But it's concerning when their efforts to protect national security actually weaken it.</p><p>You may have read about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/baltimore-ransomware.html">recent</a>ransomware attack in Baltimore, where for around three weeks hackers have effectively held the city hostage by encrypting critical files, refusing to release them unless a ransom is paid - something Baltimore has so far refused to do.</p><p>It turns out that the tool used to compromise Baltimore's systems was developed by none other than the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/us/nsa-hacking-tool-baltimore.html">National Security Agency</a> (NSA):</p><blockquote>"Since 2017, when the N.S.A. lost control of the tool, EternalBlue, it has been picked up by state hackers in North Korea, Russia and, more recently, China, to cut a path of destruction around the world, leaving billions of dollars in damage. But over the past year, the cyberweapon has boomeranged back and is now showing up in the N.S.A.’s own backyard. <br><br>It is not just in Baltimore. Security experts say EternalBlue attacks have reached a high, and cybercriminals are zeroing in on vulnerable American towns and cities, from Pennsylvania to Texas, paralyzing local governments and driving up costs. <br><br>The N.S.A. connection to the attacks on American cities has not been previously reported, in part because the agency has refused to discuss or even acknowledge the loss of its cyberweapon, dumped online in April 2017 by a still-unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. Years later, the agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation still do not know whether the Shadow Brokers are foreign spies or disgruntled insiders."</blockquote><p>If the five eyes were really concerned about the threat that hackers may have on national security, they should pay more attention to their own backyards by implementing governance frameworks that ensure their systems are as secure as possible. Baltimore could have been prevented with some relatively minor changes - in this case, making sure Windows was up to date - just as Allentown and San Antonio didn't have to happen.</p><p>They could also consider unwinding the practice of 'backdooring' software, where only the government has key (until it leaks/is cracked), a practice Australia wrote into law late last year.</p><p>But no, they're going after Huawei, a hardware supplier with no <em>proven</em>history of violating people's privacy. In terms of threat levels, protecting against security holes/malware that can be exploited to ransom data is far more important - and controllable - than the likes of Huawei, where even if its hardware was backdoored (there's no evidence it is) it would be <em>relatively</em> easy to circumvent by properly securing data at rest and in transit, something that every company/government should be doing anyway.</p><p>But none of this has ever actually been about national security. The attack on Huawei is pure politics; China needed to be 'taught a lesson', and hitting one of its largest multinationals that also happens to be leading the technological race to 5G was seen as a win-win. If Huawei were a legitimate threat, there's zero chance that it would be included as part of a trade deal with China, something President Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48392021">said was a possibility</a> only a few days ago.</p><p>If Huawei is a danger to national security then the NSA is the greatest threat on the planet, with Baltimore just the latest in a long series of attacks made possible by the US government's blasé attitude to cyber security. Yet it wants us to believe - without evidence - that Huawei is the real threat. Yeah, right.</p><h3 id="where-to-now-for-elon">Where to now for Elon?</h3><p>Elon can't take a trick of late.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you're a Chinese technology company or an American consumer, last week was not a good week for you. A refresher:</p><ul><li>The United States added Huawei and 70 affiliates to its "Entity List", effectively labelling the company as acting "contrary to US national security".</li><li>President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, barring US companies from transacting with companies on the "Entity List" on national security grounds.</li></ul><p>Huawei isn't just banned from doing business in the United States; American companies are banned from buying from or selling to it (and ZTE) at any point along the supply chain. That includes software, which means no more Google Maps or YouTube on new Huawei phones. Huawei was understandably not happy and issued this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/15/donald-trump-national-emergency-telecoms-threats-huawei">response</a>:</p><blockquote>"If the US restricts Huawei, it will not make the US safer, nor will it make the US stronger. It will only force the US to use inferior and expensive alternative equipment, lagging behind other countries ... and ultimately harming US companies and consumers."</blockquote><p>Regular readers know which side of the fence I sit on this issue. I wouldn't trust nor support a Chinese government-sponsored company any more than I would a US-sponsored company, but in this case <em>even if</em> Huawei were a government spy-pawn, there are relatively cheap and easy methods to mitigate the risks involved (and no, a "<a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3075833/huawei-offers-no-spy-contracts-and-promises-to-shut-down-if-forced-to-spy-for-china">no-spy contract</a>" is not sufficient).</p><p>What I am in favour of is competition and cheaper network infrastructure for consumers the world over, and if the Chinese government is happy to subsidise that then more power to it. Trump was supposedly on board with that, until he started to lose his 'trade war' with China. Here's a <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1098583029713420288">tweet</a> of his from two months ago, when negotiations with China were going well:</p><blockquote>"I want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do, especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology!" - President Donald Trump, 21 Feb 2019.</blockquote><p>But his attitude started to change when it became clear China was not as amicable to the US' terms as he initially thought, so he needed another avenue down which he could pressure China: national security.</p><p>It's vague enough that you don't need any actual evidence of espionage, or intent to commit espionage, and it really appeals to his voter base. When you break it down, banning Huawei (and its affiliates) is simply part of a broader political play, with national security a red herring used to slap China into submission over the ongoing trade dispute, which itself is the result of an erroneous view that there is something wrong with bilateral trade deficits.</p><p>Sadly, the entire dispute with China stems from a misunderstanding of basic economics. That misunderstanding is also about the only consistent belief Trump has held throughout his adult life. The Huawei ban is just the latest step in Trump's revival of old school - and long discredited - mercantilism, with the United States trying to protect local companies at the expense of its own consumers. World Trade Organisation rules dictate that a country can't use protectionism as a justification to restrict competition so Trump needed something else, so national security it was.</p><p>If you need a blueprint as to how this whole saga plays out from here, just read a summary of mercantilism. It's an old, fallacious theory that much like measles won't die out because of a vocal, ill-informed minority. As with measles, those who cannot be vaccinated - or those exposed to China's supply chain - will pay the highest price.</p><h3 id="some-follow-up-huawei-articles">Some follow-up Huawei articles</h3><p>I couldn't link to them all in the text above so if you're after a little bit more information, try one of these.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.axios.com/fcc-blocks-china-mobile-national-security-concerns-7eb85e53-4a71-47d4-8759-5eb8dd5979c9.html">FCC blocks China Mobile from operating in U.S. over national security concerns</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-17/trump-s-twin-volleys-against-huawei-have-u-s-companies-reeling">Trump's Twin Volleys Against Huawei Leave U.S. Companies Reeling</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3010507/huaweis-day-reckoning-arrives-it-has-been-preparing-almost-year">Huawei’s day of reckoning arrives – but it has been preparing for almost a year</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-19/google-to-end-some-huawei-business-ties-after-trump-crackdown">Top US Tech Companies Begin to Cut Off Vital Huawei Supplies</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-alphabet-exclusive/exclusive-google-suspends-some-business-with-huawei-after-trump-blacklist-source-idUSKCN1SP0NB">Google suspends some business with Huawei after Trump blacklist</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="apple-will-lobby-hard">Apple will lobby hard</h3><p>Not only did Apple lose a Supreme Court case which may eventually force it to lower fees on App Store sales, but the latest round of Trump tariffs - which could be in effect as soon as 24 June - could seriously hurt its profit margins.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-supreme-court-loss-could-harm-its-app-store-business-2019-5">Apple's surprise defeat in the Supreme Court is bad news for Tim Cook's turnaround plan</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/13/supreme-court-rules-against-apple-in-app-store-antitrust-case.html">Supreme Court deals Apple major setback in App Store antitrust case</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/14/apple-would-need-to-raise-iphone-prices-significantly-to-offset-new-tariffs-analysts-say.html">Apple would need to raise iPhone prices significantly to offset next tariffs</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="another-facebook-app-another-security-breach">Another Facebook app, another security breach</h3><p>Facebook is almost as bad at securing its applications as it is at protecting its users' privacy.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slack is "where work happens", at least if you buy its marketing slogan. It's an important slogan, as once you actually give it a try you realise it's not much more than a chat platform trying to replace the role email plays in the workplace. So how could such an 'innovation', <em>in addition to</em> email (I'll explain why later), possibly be conducive to work? Good question, and Slack even hired a consultant to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511575/productivity-slack-google-microsoft-facebook">crunch some numbers</a>:</p><blockquote>Consulting firm <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-social-economy">McKinsey said</a>back in 2012 that workplace communications technologies have the potential to increase employee productivity by up to 25 percent. <br><br>"The average interaction worker spends an estimated 28 percent of the workweek managing email and nearly 20 percent looking for internal information or tracking down colleagues who can help with specific tasks," according to the study. McKinsey figured people would be able to more easily and quickly accomplish these task using new workplace software.</blockquote><p>The problem lies in the assumption that Slack would displace email. It hasn't, won't and worse, it's actually <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511575/productivity-slack-google-microsoft-facebook">just another</a> time and productivity sink:</p><blockquote>"Applied to Slack, its greatest strength: amazing ease-of-use, is also its weakness: making it far too easy for everyone to default to using Slack for communicating, even for all the myriad things that don’t make sense to use Slack to communicate,” software programmer Alicia Liu wrote last year in a <a href="https://medium.com/counter-intuition/the-hidden-side-of-using-slack-2443d9b66f8a">Medium post</a>. <br><br>“By lowering the barrier to initiate communication, the hidden side effect is that Slack has the quiet capacity to exponentially increase communication overhead. Resulting in much more voluminous, lower quality communication."</blockquote><p>I searched around for how some people might have mitigated that issue in practice, and... it's difficult. Unless you turn Slack back into email, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19644613">that is</a>:</p><blockquote>"It's not just about the tool but how you use it. For us it actually helps to get less distracted. There are very few things that require a sub 3 hour reaction. So we just put a question in Slack even if it's for the person sitting right next to you. Eventually the person will answer when they have some time. Much better than constantly having someone tipping one your shoulder or calling you. <br><br>Just because you have instant messages doesn't mean you have to respond instantly. Disable notifications and checking every few hours is plenty enough. If a person can't work because of a pending question, it usually means they don't have their work organised sufficiently."</blockquote><p>My view of Slack is that it's a less-searchable email alternative without subject lines that tends to devolve into a medium for casual banter where all real work has to be channelled back through email anyway (as what you actually want is interspersed within that banter).</p><p>In other words, Slack is next to useless as a place "where work happens".</p><p>But what do I know. Slack has 10 million daily active users and recently filed for an initial public offering (IPO), with a valuation at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/25/slack-valued-at-17-billion-on-secondary-market-ahead-of-public-debut.html">close to $17 billion</a>. When a number of the Silicon Valley unicorns eventually come crashing down to earth as the current expansion draws to a close, I can't help but feel that Slack will be leading the pack.</p><h3 id="we-re-from-the-government-and-we-re-here-to-help">We're from the government and we're here to help</h3><p>The nine most terrifying words in the English language.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no debate that social media began as a platform. As I wrote in Issue 16/2019:</p><blockquote>"Just to be clear, social networks are not publishers, they're platforms. If an article is shared on Twitter, that doesn't suddenly make Twitter the article's publisher; it's simply one of many distribution platforms for that article... Blaming platforms because you don't like the content people distribute on them very quickly starts to resemble blaming books because you don't like the content printed in them."</blockquote><p>The censors and their legion of snowflakes have acknowledged that point, so they've been pushing hard for social media platforms to become publishers. And big tech is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18526964/facebook-ban-alex-jones-laura-loomer-milo-louis-farrakhan">walking</a> right <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-youtube/google-spends-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-on-content-review-letter-idUSKCN1S81OK">into</a> it:</p><blockquote>"Facebook today removed Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones, Paul Nehlen, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Infowars from Facebook and Instagram, saying their accounts violated <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/dangerous_individuals_organizations">its policies against dangerous individuals and organizations</a>. They will be prohibited from creating new accounts, although Facebook and Instagram users will continue to be able to create posts praising them and their viewpoints, the company said. Facebook did not disclose all of the incidents that led to the accounts’ removal, saying that it had made the decisions following a period of review. <br><br>Twitter said a “substantial portion” of its 4,100-person global workforce are involved in reviewing content. <br><br>Alphabet’s ... expenses have surged faster than revenue for much of the past two years, concerning some investors amid increased scrutiny on the company’s privacy practices and YouTube. Google said in its letter it has more than 10,000 people working across the company on content review."</blockquote><p>These companies have voluntarily moved away from platform status, where users are (mostly) in control of the content shared on that platform, into the realm of publishing, where they more closely resemble traditional media outlets (e.g. newspapers). The problem is that in doing so, they have opened themselves up to the same rules and regulations that publishers face, hence the enormous expenditure on content moderation. As large-scale publishers they now need armies of lawyers and moderators (i.e. editors) to process the enormous quantity of content that their users (i.e. freelancers) upload and share.</p><p>Just to clarify, I'm not saying that platforms can use their status to shirk all responsibility for the content uploaded to their servers; things like the shooting video in Christchurch should absolutely have been taken down as soon as possible, as social norms make pretty clear (unlike the Alex Jones decision, which more than 20 Facebook and Instagram executives <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/facebook-emails-reveal-discussion-about-alex-jones-instagram-account-2019-3">debated for months</a>).</p><p>But Facebook, Twitter and YouTube barely resemble platforms any more. By moving in a direction so far beyond the content moderation threshold dictated by social norms they have laid the groundwork to one day be forced to surrender their platform status. And that eventual transition from platform to publisher creates a few problems.</p><p>First, costs will rise enormously. Facebook, Google (sucked into this mess via YouTube) and Twitter will find themselves spending more and more on content moderation and defending lawsuits.</p><p>Second, it opens them up to competition. While they have the first-mover and network effect advantage for the moment, who's to say an alternative won't come along and stress the "platform" aspect of its rival service?</p><p>Third and finally, it may fundamentally change the internet as we know it. The likes of the European union are passing privacy-focused, innovation-stifling legislation on a seemingly daily basis. Other countries will follow. How long until the "China model" becomes more widespread (Australia for example is already well on its way)?</p><p>Whatever the case, I don't like big tech's transition from platform to publisher. There's a risk they become utilified in the process, walling off competition and locking in an inefficient "path" for years to come. But with any luck they'll become the architects of their own downfall before that happens.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a week for Elon Musk, and not in a good way. If you need a refresher:</p><ul><li>After markets closed on Friday, Tesla announced the departure of four board members once their current terms expire.</li><li>On Monday last week, a parked Tesla Model S randomly <a href="https://qz.com/1601177/a-video-showed-a-parked-tesla-model-s-exploding-in-shanghai/">exploded</a> in a Shanghai garage (and it was captured by CCTV).</li><li>Two days prior to Tesla's mid-week first quarter earnings release Musk promised self-driving by the end of this year. But given that we hear that promise every year - Musk first made the claim back in 2015 - he upped the ante, saying Tesla would have one million <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-selfdriving/tesla-says-robotaxis-coming-next-year-touts-self-driving-microchip-idUSKCN1RY1C9">self-driving robo-taxis</a> on the road in 2020.</li><li>The first quarter earnings report was unveiled and wow was it bad, showing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/tesla-reports-702-million-loss-in-first-quarter/">loss of $702 million</a>, or $4.10 a share.</li><li>During the earnings call Musk was asked if Tesla planned to get into the insurance business, to which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/elon-musk-tesla-will-launch-an-insurance-product-in-about-a-month.html">he responded</a>"...yes we are creating a Tesla insurance product and we hope to launch that in about a month. It will be much more compelling than anything else out there". A bold claim given how poorly Musk's promises have panned out in the past!</li><li>Tesla's share price closed at $US235.14 on Friday, its lowest since January 2017.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/tesla-share-price-april2019.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Let's be honest, we're not going to see a million Tesla robo-taxis on the road by 2020; it's another Musk pipe dream on which he has applied an absurdly short, unrealistic time frame.</p><p>Really the only interesting announcement was the Tesla insurance product, and it wasn't even an announcement but an on-the-fly comment during the investor call. Does Musk actually have an insurance company in the works, or did he just think it was a good idea? The guy has a reputation for shooting from the hip, but insurance does actually make sense: Tesla already spies <a href="https://www.axios.com/what-tesla-knows-about-you-1f21d287-a204-4a6e-8b4a-0786b0afac45.html">on all of its drivers</a>so Musk's statement that people wouldn't be allowed "to drive the car in a crazy way" if they want to keep premiums down claim should actually be relatively easy to enforce.</p><p>It's also a means for Tesla to do one of two things: crack the cash flow market that the likes of Apple have recently pivoted into (monthly subscriptions for everything); and/or bundle the insurance into the sale price as a bit of a loss leader, which is similar to how traditional car dealers bundle free annual services into their vehicle sales.</p><p>The latter is the most intriguing, as it's a point of difference for Tesla which is finally starting to face some healthy competition in the pure electric vehicle sector. That competition is coming at the same time as governments around the world are finally winding down their extremely generous electric vehicle subsidies, which have been Tesla's <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/tesla-s-main-product-isn-t-cars-it-s-subsidies-14769263">bread and butter</a> for some time.</p><p>But will insurance be enough to save a company that haemorrhages <a href="https://qz.com/1604080/tesla-is-losing-money-at-a-frightening-pace/">nearly a million dollars a day</a>? I'm not so sure and I'm clearly not alone, hence the Tesla share price free-fall.</p><h3 id="only-you-not-europe-can-protect-your-privacy">Only you, not Europe, can protect your privacy</h3><p>The fabled General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is enforced in the country in which tech firms have their "data controller".

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I trust everyone had a relaxing Easter long weekend. This week's issue will be shorter than usual as I just want to briefly touch on a subject of immense frustration but more importantly, opportunity: banking.</p><p>If there's any industry that's ripe for disruption it must be the financial sector. Heavily regulated and dominated by a handful of large, often very old corporations, it can be an absolute chore to perform basic tasks that <em>should</em> be easy, such as transferring money. It's a sector seemingly littered with inefficiencies and annoyances at just about every turn, yet it continues to grow in terms of its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP, see the <strong>Image of the Week</strong> at the bottom of this issue).</p><p>I was hopeful that Apple's much-hyped credit card would break out of that mould but it took the easy way out, partnering with a bank to create yet another run-of-the-mill credit card. Then there was last week's announcement that T-Mobile, an internet telecom in the US, would be releasing "T-Mobile Money", a no-fee transaction account that represents <a href="https://gizmodo.com/t-mobiles-next-big-move-is-a-checking-account-1834124070">slightly better value</a>than existing offerings for those will low balances (a 4% interest rate on the first $3,000, with 1% on anything above that). But it's still just same old, same old.</p><p>The financial sector won't be disrupted by tech companies that think they can beat the banks at their own game by producing an expensive card (Apple) or a fancy mobile app (T-Mobile). To truly shake the incumbents will require technology that can get past the requisite utilification of every player in the sector: a way to verify and guarantee transactions without the need for large, centralised systems of trust (banks) and the regulation that - by design - oppresses innovation.</p><p>We may not have invented that technology (yet). But it's looking increasingly likely that we have at least ventured down the right path, and that path is blockchain. The speculative fervor that surrounded everything crypto has passed and as <em>Issue 18/2019</em>pointed out, the wheat is finally being separated from the chaff. Simply existing in the blockchain space is no longer enough; only the best products - in terms of how well they can compete with existing industries (think Uber and taxis) - will grow in terms of market share and potentially, one day, market dominance.</p><p>I'm hopeful that at least one of those products will flip the banking industry upside down, eroding the rents they currently enjoy similarly to how Uber decimated the taxi cartel. The consumer surplus in doing so would be enormous.</p><h3 id="artificial-intelligence-is-great-aside-from-the-name">Artificial intelligence is great, aside from the name</h3><p>As with any emerging field, there will be winners and losers.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In news that really should have surprised no one, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-10/is-anyone-listening-to-you-on-alexa-a-global-team-reviews-audio">Bloomberg revealed</a> that audio captured by Amazon Alexa-enabled devices is actually listened to by humans:</p><blockquote>"The team listens to voice recordings captured in Echo owners’ homes and offices. The recordings are transcribed, annotated and then fed back into the software as part of an effort to eliminate gaps in Alexa’s understanding of human speech and help it better respond to commands... A screenshot reviewed by Bloomberg shows that the recordings sent to the Alexa reviewers don’t provide a user’s full name and address but are associated with an account number, as well as the user’s first name and the device’s serial number."</blockquote><p>So much for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. As I wrote last week, these things can't actually <em>understand </em>anything; they use algorithms to scan an enormous database and pick a response based on the probability that it's correct. Humans will always be needed to improve those algorithms given that language constantly evolves:</p><blockquote>"But sometimes Alexa gets it wrong—especially when grappling with new slang, regional colloquialisms or languages other than English. In French, avec sa, “with his” or “with her,” can confuse the software into thinking someone is using the Alexa wake word. Hecho, Spanish for a fact or deed, is sometimes misinterpreted as Echo. And so on. That’s why Amazon recruited human helpers to fill in the gaps missed by the algorithms."</blockquote><p>Terms like machine learning and artificial intelligence are deceptive in that "learning" and "intelligence" are misdefined. There's no learning or intelligence happening, at least as the average person would understand those words to mean. These algorithms are giant probability machines, with humans doing the learning for them by informing the algorithm whether a response was appropriate or not, effectively tweaking and redefining its probability model.</p><p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are the result of brilliant marketing, and the probability models that they use are fantastic. But as we've now discovered with Amazon (Apple's Siri also uses humans in the same way), it has created a bit of an issue in terms of privacy - people don't think that other people are listening in on their conversations:</p><blockquote>"You don’t necessarily think of another human listening to what you’re telling your smart speaker in the intimacy of your home," said Florian Schaub, a professor at the University of Michigan who has researched privacy issues related to smart speakers. <br><br>"I think we’ve been conditioned to the [assumption] that these machines are just doing magic machine learning. But the fact is there is still manual processing involved." <br><br>“Whether that’s a privacy concern or not depends on how cautious Amazon and other companies are in what type of information they have manually annotated, and how they present that information to someone,” he added.</blockquote><p>If the constant data breaches at Facebook (and many other companies / governments) have taught us anything, large central databases filled with a diverse set of user information is a honey pot just begging to be hacked. If you absolutely must have a voice activated assistant to play your music or set an alarm, consider privacy-friendly alternatives such as <a href="https://mycroft.ai/">Mycroft</a> or <a href="https://snips.ai/">Snips</a>, which give you full control over your data.</p><h3 id="artificial-intelligence-really">Artificial intelligence. Really?</h3><p>I'm not against artificial intelligence, although I detest the name. Likewise machine learning. The marketing of those two words has gone too far, and as a result so have the expectations.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is overrated, both in terms of its potential for improving productivity and the threat it might one day pose to humanity. When you break it down, AI is really nothing more than various algorithms that mimic human behaviour. There's no real knowledge or <strong>understanding</strong>; it's just a very fast, enormous database containing information about how to best react to certain events.</p><p>Don't get me wrong: AI will, given time, replace or complement many jobs where the goals are clear and following the rules is critical. Much of the world's supply chain is ripe for AI disruption, for example. But AI will never be able to innovate and solve problems in uncontrolled environments, something humans do all the time. We don't live on a chess board with a finite number of strategies and options but a dynamic, ever-changing and evolving place we call the universe.</p><p>I see far too many people and companies are over-promising when it comes to the potential of AI, it stinks of snake oil and I now actively avoid those that claim to rely on it to any significant extent. I have no doubt that AI is in a bit of a publicity bubble and many of the companies <em>supposedly</em> involved will go the way that those adding "blockchain" to their names/descriptions did when the Bitcoin bubble burst.</p><p>Then there are those who over-hype the potential risks AI poses to humanity. For example, you may have seen the video that researchers at the <a href="https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/AudioToObama/">University of Washington</a>put together of former President Obama, where they - to a high degree of accuracy - could basically make him say anything they wanted.</p><p>Such videos are known as a "deepfake", or AI-generated videos that look and sound like the person in them but are entirely computer generated. As the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/technology/fake-videos-deepfakes.html">reported</a>:</p><blockquote>"It's not hard to imagine this technology's being used to smear politicians, create counterfeit revenge porn or frame people for crimes. Lawmakers have already begun to worry about how deepfakes could be used for political sabotage and propaganda."</blockquote><p>But without some kind of credible verification - an organisation such as the New York Times, for example (although I'd want something more reliable!) - why would anyone believe a video was real, any more than they would a quoted block of text?</p><p>This fear of "fakes" is not new and AI-generated fake videos are just the latest iteration in a long history of fraud. Thankfully, it's actually easier than ever to prove the credibility of a source now that we have the internet to speed the whole process up, along with advances in verification techniques such as digital signatures. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/fake-news-long-history-beware-state-involvement">The Guardian</a> notes:</p><blockquote>"If there is a long history to fears about fake news, there is a long history to fake news too. In 1924, four days before a general election, the Daily Mail published the forged Zinoviev letter, a supposed directive from Moscow to British communists to mobilise “sympathetic forces” in the Labour party; Labour lost the election by a landslide." <br><br>"In 1989, the Sun, fed lies by the police, ran a campaign to besmirch Liverpool football fans after 96 supporters died at Hillsborough, crushed to death after being forced into an overcrowded caged pen. The Sun invented stories of drunken fans as the cause of the disaster." <br><br>"In 2003, in the run-up to the Iraq war, articles about Saddam Hussein’s nonexistent weapons of mass destruction filled newspaper pages across the world."</blockquote><p>The problem of fake news is no worse with the internet and AI-generated videos than it was when letters and newspapers were delivered on foot. Governments will still lie to their people, journalists will still invent quotes and people who want to verify claims will still have to seek out the original source, or at least some kind of proof (e.g. public key digital signatures) that the source is in fact credible.</p><h3 id="americans-still-love-apple">Americans still love Apple</h3><p>There has been a lot of hate for Apple this week following its underwhelming Spring product launch (note that investors don't seem too concerned; its share price is up more than 5% since the event).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple had its big spring product launch last week and it was "meh" at best. As most Apple observers have come to expect, the focus of the event was not on shiny new devices but a handful of new subscription services, with celebrities trotted out to spruik the new offerings in a not-so-subtle attempt to paper over the company's recent lack of ideas. Indeed, not only were there no new products (other than run of the mill hardware upgrades for existing ones), but Apple announced late on Friday that its much-hyped "AirPower" charging device would be <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/03/apples-airpower-wireless-charger-is-officially-dead/">thrown on the scrapheap</a>, a rare move for Apple.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/cook-oprah-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption><em>Oprah "[Apple's] in a billion pockets y'all" Winfrey led the all-star cast.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Celebrity aside, the spring product launch revealed further details about Apple's ongoing struggle to reinvent itself. You see, in the face of fierce competition from device manufacturers in Asia, Apple has been gradually transitioning its business model away from the device market towards services, a direction its CEO Tim Cook has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-the-iphone-sputtering-apple-bets-its-future-on-tv-and-news-11553437018">moving the company</a> since at least 2014.</p><p>So it was again last week, with the technology behemoth announcing details about a handful of new services: TV+, News+, Apple Arcade (a video game subscription service), along with the most interesting of all, the "Apple Card", a credit card offering. I'm going to deal with each one very briefly, before finishing with the credit card (scroll down if you don't care about the rest).</p><p><strong>TV+</strong></p><p>Apple TV (no plus) is a small box that connects to your TV and plays content from various sources. The 'plus' stands for an upcoming ad-free subscription service, much like Netflix and its competitors including Amazon, Disney, Hulu, AT&amp;T/WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal. Apple's advantage is that it already has a somewhat captive fan base (the users of its products, not just Apple TV devices) who will at least give it a shot for a month or two. But if you can't produce <em>quality</em> original content to keep them there, it will all be for moot - and Apple's issues in this space are <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/04/original-content-tv-dont-be-mean/">well</a> <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/09/apples-upcoming-streaming-service-is-reportedly-so-bland-staff-are-calling-it-expensive-nbc/">documented</a>.</p><p><strong>News+</strong></p><p>As with TV+, Apple News+ is the same old Apple News (no plus) with some exclusive content thrown in. In the case of News+, that bonus content is access to an additional 300 magazines. It's essentially the Texture app - the "Netflix of magazine publishing", which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/12/apple-acquires-digital-newsstand-texture-as-it-doubles-down-on-content-from-trusted-sources/">purchased</a>about a year ago - re-branded as an Apple product. I can see how some people might find it useful to have Apple aggregate your news for you but I'm certainly not one of them.</p><p><strong>Apple Arcade</strong></p><p>What is Apple Arcade? You guessed it: another aggregator with a monthly subscription attached. Apple is going to "handpick" a number of existing games on its App Store that will henceforth be available exclusively on Apple Arcade, without any advertising or dreaded microtransactions (in-app purchases). Mobile gaming is growing - especially among the younger generation - and microtransactions are the bane for many a parent, so this could be a good alternative for them. As with News+ it won't cost Apple much to roll this out given that the content already exists, so it's worth a shot.</p><p><strong>Apple Card</strong></p><p>Finally the most interesting of the bunch, the Apple Card. Financial technology - 'FinTech' - is all the rage, and Apple wants a piece of the action. Credit where credit is due (pun intended), this card is a thing of beauty. Made with titanium and able to generate virtual card numbers for non-Apple Pay purchases (provided you have your phone handy), it's a very neat little credit card.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/apple-card.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>But as with everything else announced last week, it's nothing remarkable; it's yet another sign that Apple's days at the frontier of technology are effectively over. When I heard rumours of the Card I was hoping for an announcement along the lines of the recent Facebook/Telegram/Signal battle to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/technology/cryptocurrency-facebook-telegram.html">offer instant payments</a>via blockchain, but instead we got a card that doesn't have/do anything that isn't already available from competitors (1-3% cash back on purchases, yay!). It's essentially a line of credit from Goldman Sachs, subject to the same constraints as any other MasterCard or Visa card out there.</p><p>All up, I wasn't optimistic about the spring product launch and I somehow still left disappointed. The big test for Apple from here will be whether it's able to sustain the inevitable flood of subscriptions to its new services once the celebrity factor wears off (as Oprah said, their devices are in a billion pockets), subscription fatigue sets in and people start to question whether they actually need multiple $9.99 a month Apple subscriptions when there are plenty of better, cheaper alternatives out there.</p><h3 id="shock-horror-zuckerberg-wants-to-be-regulated">Shock! Horror! Zuckerberg wants to be regulated</h3><p>The Zuck suddenly wants global regulations covering "harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability". Why would he possibly want that? Could it be because Facebook has sunk enormous amounts of capital into those four areas, and is even in the process of encrypting its messaging applications ahead of a possible revenue pivot into FinTech? Good luck competing with Facebook if Zuck gets his way - complying with Facebook will almost certainly become too costly for anyone other than Facebook.

This week I'm going to let Jean Tirole do the talking:</p><blockquote>"[W]e need to distinguish between statics and dynamics, or between a transient monopoly and a permanent one. Large economies of scale as well as substantial network externalities imply that we often have monopolies or tight oligopolies in the new economy. The key issue is that of “contestability.” Monopolies are not ideal, but they deliver value to the consumers as long as potential competition keeps them on their toes. They will then be forced to innovate and possibly even to charge low prices so as to preserve a large installed base and try to make it difficult for the entrants to dislodge them."</blockquote><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://qz.com/1310266/nobel-winning-economist-jean-tirole-on-how-to-regulate-tech-monopolies/">A Nobel-winning economist’s guide to taming tech monopolies</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="huawei-on-top-of-the-world">Huawei on top of the world</h3><p>Huawei might have been banned by several technologically illiterate backwaters (e.g. Australia) but that doesn't seem to have affected its bottom line, with profits up 25% to nearly $9 billion last year. 2019 will be a tougher year, with the bans and a slowing Chinese economy likely to have a more significant effect than in 2018.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-security-eu/eu-demands-scrutiny-of-5g-risks-but-no-bloc-wide-huawei-ban-idUSKCN1R71VK">EU demands scrutiny of 5G risks but no bloc-wide Huawei ban</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/technology/huawei-security-british-report.html">Huawei Security ‘Defects’ Are Found by British Authorities</a> »</li><li><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/28/tech/huawei-earnings-china/index.html">Huawei's profits jump by 25% despite US efforts to curtail its business</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="europe-is-splitting-the-internet">Europe is splitting the internet</h3><p>Europe, Europe, Europe.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mosque shootings that took place in Christchurch, New Zealand on 15 March were an act of pure evil, rightfully condemned by just about everyone around the world save for a few lunatics on the fringe. Without in any way belittling the tragic loss of life, I want to quickly touch on one unintended consequence that has followed the tragedy: Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's second youngest ever Prime Minister.</p><p>Ardern's response to the crisis has been hailed as exemplary by both sides of the political spectrum, and she has rocketed to international fame. I wouldn't normally have an issue with that (New Zealand's a very nice place, with relatively sensible politicians), but Ardern has decided that she will use her newfound fame to push for the censorship of social media. You see, the perpetrator of the Christchurch shooting live streamed the whole thing to Facebook via a camera attached to his helmet, and Facebook took a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-our-ai-tools-failed-to-catch-new-zealand-attack-video-11553156141">long time to notice</a> (half an hour <strong>after</strong> a user brought it to the company’s attention).</p><p>Ardern rightly wasn't happy about that and being a politician, she wants to do what politicians always do when fear levels are running high.</p><p><strong>Something.</strong></p><p>Her logic is simple: a Bad Thing happened; people spread video of the Bad Thing via social media; therefore, social media needs to be controlled to stop any future Bad Things being spread. In Ardern's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/facebook-and-youtube-defend-response-to-christchurch-videos">own words</a>:</p><blockquote>"We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published. They are the publisher, not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility."</blockquote><p>Just to be clear, social networks are not publishers, they're platforms. If an article is shared on Twitter, that doesn't suddenly make Twitter the article's publisher; it's simply one of many distribution platforms for that article.</p><p>But back to Ardern. Did Facebook want the shooting video on its website? Of course not. Should it have been faster at removing it? Absolutely. But its delay was due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/21/facebook-could-have-moved-faster-on-christchurch-video-if-it-were-suicide">a flaw</a>in its AI algorithms and manual reporting processes, not because it's "all profit, no responsibility". Blaming platforms because you don't like the content people distribute on them very quickly starts to resemble blaming books because you don't like the content printed in them. And we all know how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451">that turns out</a>.</p><p>To be fair, Ardern is not the first person to call for the censorship of social media. Two bastions of free speech acted against Facebook well before the shooting, with the social network banned entirely in China and Russia deciding <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-putin-signs-fake-news-legislation/29828242.html">last week</a> to ban "fake news" and "insults". But the devil is in the detail:</p><blockquote>"The new legislation allows the authorities to block websites or internet accounts that publish what they deem to be "fake news" and penalizing those who post material found to be insulting to state officials, state symbols, or Russian society."</blockquote><p>A Russian tsar will determine what is "fake" or not. I'm not entirely sure what Ardern's plan for social media is but it's probably not dissimilar (it would be almost impossible to enforce without such a body). It's also unlikely to be New Zealand specific; Ardern has called for "<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/new-zealand-christchurch-jacinda-ardern-social-media-11362390">a united front on a global issue</a>":</p><blockquote>"This is not just an issue for New Zealand, the fact that social media platforms have been used to spread violence (and) material that incites violence. All of us need to present a united front."</blockquote><p>Right, that old chestnut. Politicians, much like water, will almost always follow the path of least resistance and social media was already firmly in their sights. In the words of former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, a good politician should "never let a serious crisis go to waste". Ardern is a good politician and she is capitalising on the fear and emotion invoked by this tragedy to push her agenda.</p><p>Just because Ardern behaved exactly as most people would want a leader to act following a similar tragedy doesn't suddenly make her policies wise choices. A "united front" against social media platforms won't get rid of the people and ideas Ardern rightfully condemns, it will just push them further into the deep corners of the web where those ideas will fester and grow unchallenged. Her government's decision to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/3003087/new-zealand-bans-manifesto-accused-christchurch-killer">ban the shooter's manifesto</a> tells you all you need to know about its views on the importance of free speech.</p><p>The problem with Ardern's proposal, and with censorship in general, is that once you start it's hard to stop. Social media might be the villain today, but tomorrow it'll be something else. Every action has unintended consequences, and those consequences tend to be more severe when governments are responding quickly to the public's fear.</p><p>Cooler heads may well prevail, but Ardern is on a bit of a role and many otherwise sensible people seem to have checked their brains at the door, so I'm not hopeful. I don't like the big social media platforms, but labelling them publishers and regulating them to the point that they become utilitised is not the correct response to this tragedy.</p><h3 id="crypto-is-dead-long-live-crypto-">Crypto is dead; long live crypto!</h3><p>In line with Satoshi's original vision, the most likely industry to be disrupted by blockchain technology is financial services.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems barely a day goes by without another insight into Facebook's nefarious nature, with critics lining up to take a swing at the embattled company. By this late stage - Facebook is now 15 years old! - there's barely anyone left on the planet who isn't aware of Facebook's numerous misgivings. I have written extensively about Facebook's constant abuse of its users' data and why I have avoided the company and anything it touches like the plague for the better part of this decade.</p><p>While in the past Facebook's patient zero, Mark Zuckerberg, has been able to successfully deflect attention and carry on as usual, lately it seems he can't take a trick. The bad news really is starting to add up for the advertising behemoth, with the announcement on Wednesday that the company is being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/facebook-data-deals-investigation.html">criminally investigated</a> for its dodgy data deals:</p><blockquote>"Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation into data deals Facebook struck with some of the world’s largest technology companies, intensifying scrutiny of the social media giant’s business practices as it seeks to rebound from a year of scandal and setbacks."</blockquote><p>That was followed by the apparently unrelated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/technology/facebook-chris-cox.html">resignation</a> of two top executives on Thursday:</p><blockquote>"Two of Facebook’s top executives — one regarded as the company’s No. 3, and the other the head of its WhatsApp messaging service — are leaving after disagreements with Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, over the social network’s future direction."</blockquote><p>As we have come to expect with Facebook, the statements released by the departing executives and Zuckerberg himself were of the deliberately opaque, corporate-speak variety (curiously Chris Daniels, former head of WhatsApp, didn't provide a statement).</p><p><strong>So why the exit?</strong></p><p>Did they jump ship because of the Federal investigation, or because of a difference of opinion with Zuckerberg? Or some combination of both? Chris Cox - now former chief product officer - alluded to the latter, singling out the forthcoming integration of Facebook's various messaging platforms (Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram) in his departure letter:</p><blockquote>"As Mark has outlined, we are turning a new page in our product direction, focused on an encrypted, interoperable, messaging network. It's a product vision attuned to the subject matter of today: a modern communications platform that balances expression, safety, security, and privacy. This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through."</blockquote><p>Given that one of the executives was head of WhatsApp and the other explicitly mentioned the messaging integration as a reason for his departure, I think it's safe to say that they might have some misgivings about the direction in which Facebook is heading.</p><p><strong>What I don't know</strong></p><p>What side of the privacy fence did these two individuals stand? For instance, did they clash with Zuckerberg because they were worried about what would happen to the bottom line if they encrypted private messages on all of Facebook's platforms? That's a legitimate concern; if end-to-end encryption were properly implemented, Facebook would no longer be able to scan people's messages to improve its algorithms, which it uses to sell advertisements. Under that scenario Zuckerberg is a saint, which leads me to almost entirely dismiss it out of hand given his track record of, well, doing the opposite.</p><p>The second and more likely scenario, especially given the fact that WhatsApp and Instagram's founders quit Facebook due to Zuckerberg's lust for profit at any cost, is that the Zuck is trying to pull the wool over our eyes yet again. Facebook's encryption for all could just be a way for Zuckerberg to unify all of his various messaging applications, win some privacy brownie points, all the while maintaining access to everyone's private data for Facebook's exclusive use whenever it so desires.</p><p><strong>Zuckerberg doesn't care about privacy</strong></p><p>Encryption is only reliable when you and only you control your private keys, something I'm almost positive Facebook does not and will not tolerate, no matter what Zuckerberg may say publicly. All of Facebook's applications are closed-source, meaning no one outside of those directly involved know whether or not it has kept its own copy of people's private keys. WhatsApp is encrypted - it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol">Signal protocol</a>- but no one outside of Facebook can guarantee that it doesn't have a copy of the keys, and as you would expect WhatsApp's encryption has never been independently audited.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Zuckerberg's recent encryption and privacy epiphany; it's about time that big tech began to acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, selling out your users isn't the best long-term business strategy (although I might need to redefine long-term..!). But Facebook is the last company I would expect to lead the privacy charge, given that its core - Zuckerberg himself - is about as rotten as they come.</p><p><strong>A third scenario</strong></p><p>There is a third scenario that when combined with the recent pressure placed on the company by the likes of Elizabeth Warren and the ongoing federal investigation, might explain Zuckerberg's recent concern for his users' privacy. It's a scenario under which Facebook pivots into the remittance/payment sector, using its forthcoming integrated encrypted messaging platform - most people don't know what a private key is, let alone care that Facebook will keep a copy - to facilitate low-fee financial transactions via blockchain technology.</p><p>Facebook has been investing in that sector for some time, with Barclays <a href="https://www.ccn.com/facebook-cryptocurrency-could-raise-19-billion-reinvigorate-company-barclays">estimating</a>that a move into the payments industry could be worth around $19 billion in additional annual revenue should Facebook pull it off. Such a pivot would have the dual effect of getting the regulators off its back while also offsetting any loss in advertising revenue resulting from, at least in theory, losing the ability to scan people's private messages.</p><p>Personally, I would never send anything over Facebook (or any of its many other companies), let alone money. But I'm clearly in the minority, so it may just work.</p><h3 id="new-york-subsidies-for-everyone-except-amazon-">New York subsidies for everyone (except Amazon)</h3><p>If you thought New York's Amazon deal was bad (and really, it was actually pretty good), then surely you'll be appalled at its Hudson Yards deal, an "expansive real estate development that is about to open in Manhattan". The cost to taxpayers? About $6 billion, with nearly $4 billion spent on infrastructure and "interest payments on bonds when revenue from the development, which was supposed to cover the tab, fell short of projections".</p><p>Note that Amazon was only due to receive about ~$505 million in direct subsidies, with the rest of the purported $3 billion in the form of tax cuts derived from revenue which New York will no longer receive anyway.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/nyregion/hudson-yards-new-york-tax-breaks.html">Amazon’s Tax Breaks and Incentives Were Big.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren last week <a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c">unveiled her plan</a> to take on 'big tech', with the likes of Amazon, Google and Facebook firmly in the firing line. As Warren stated:</p><blockquote>"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation. That's why my Administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition—including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google."</blockquote><p>The pitchforks are out for big tech and Washington wants its pound of flesh. To be honest, I'm surprised it took this long; I've been writing about their shady business practises for some time and personally no longer patronise Google and Facebook. They're essentially advertising companies masquerading as a social network / search engine, but for various reasons the vast majority of people are happy with that exchange (for the moment).</p><p>But back to Warren. Here we have a politician in full campaign mode trying to out-populist her populist opponents. Going after big tech is clearly her gimmick for 2020; she can't take any credit for the abomination that is the "Green New Deal", so why not go after the tech giants that everyone loves to use but no one really likes?</p><p>I've already covered how regulating Facebook would likely further entrench its market position, but Warren's plan goes far further than simple regulation. She wants new rules for any social media, search platform or marketplace with $25 billion or more in annual revenue, preventing them from buying/owning companies that also sell services on those marketplaces.</p><p>As is often the case with political campaign gimmicks, Warren has not stated anywhere how such a law would make anyone better off. Where she tried to explain how it would not make anyone <strong>worse</strong> off, she failed. Hard.</p><p>For example, for some reason Warren is under the impression that you will still be able to "go on Google and search like you do today", even though she acknowledges that her plan would force Google Search to be spun off from the rest of Google (i.e. advertising). But without AdWords, Google Search may no longer even exist and if it does, won't exist in its present form. The business model of Google Search is literally to drive revenue to Google Ads, something it wouldn't be allowed to do post-Warren; how it would adapt is anyone's guess but it almost certainly wouldn't work as it does today.</p><p>But my biggest gripe with Warren's big tech gimmick is that none of the companies targeted by her plan are even monopolies, nor do they have the "power" she thinks they do. Yes, the sector has become more concentrated, but that's not due to a lack of competition; the market is concentrated because of network effects, lock-in and economies of scale.</p><p>If anything, the likes of Amazon, Google and Facebook are market drivers forcing others - both existing businesses and potential entrants - to constantly improve to compete, and their place at the top is only ever one innovation away from being toppled. Their size and profitability are simply the result of doing what they do better than anyone else.</p><p>Since the mid-1990s, consumer goods prices have increased at a slower rate than average earnings in virtually every year (just <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=ndXR">ask the Fed</a>), in part thanks to Amazon's disruptive presence. There's also no obvious decline in entrepreneurship as a result of big tech (see <strong>Image of the week</strong> at the bottom), and the big tech companies <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/4/9/17204004/amazon-research-development-rd">spend more on R&amp;D</a>than companies in any other sector. While the crimes Warren ascribes to big tech are certainly applicable to other sectors, she has picked the wrong fight here. Her whole plan reads as if it were written by someone examining a purely static state of affairs, with no concept of the dynamic and rapidly changing world in which these big tech companies actually exist.</p><p>I don't expect Warren to get much traction with what amounts to a poor attempt at posturing herself as the "anti-big tech" candidate, and indeed if she sticks with the plan in its current form it may even be enough to cost her the Democratic nomination. Regardless of political beliefs, the majority of the voting population are intelligent enough to realise that no one is forcing them to use Amazon, Facebook or Google, and that there are plenty of alternatives should those companies try to abuse their so-called power.</p><h3 id="mobile-devices">Mobile devices</h3><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/folding-phones-wait-for-glass/">Want a foldable phone? Hold out for real glass</a> »</p><p>Samsung and Huawei's recently announced foldable phones use a plastic polymer for their screens instead of glass. But while more flexible, plastic also scratches from day 1 and will eventually develop a crease in the middle. Just another reason not to buy the first or second generations - Corning and competitors like Japan’s AGC think foldable glass will be ready within a couple of years.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-06/samsung-is-said-to-be-preparing-more-foldable-smartphone-models">Samsung Working on Two More Foldable Smartphones</a> »</p><p>Apparently one of the new foldable phones will be a clamshell-like device, similar to the rumoured Motorola Razr I mentioned last week.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I wrote about how a number of Western governments around the world feared the possibility of being compromised by the Chinese government. Namely, they worried that if they allowed China's Huawei to install components in their respective 5G networks, they would be taking an unnecessary risk. That fear was so great that the Australian government went as far as banning the company from supplying its 5G network entirely, despite the fact that it would in all likelihood reduce outcomes for consumers.</p><p>The technical grounds on which Huawei was banned are shaky at best. Just about every "hack" you hear about in the news - they are occurring on far too regular a basis, I might add - usually involves one of two methods. One, the data were stored unencrypted, i.e. in plain text, on a server somewhere; and/or two, access was gained through so-called social hacking, i.e. finding a weak human link in the chain and exploiting them.</p><p>From a security perspective the least concerning part of a system is the network infrastructure itself. It's a given these days that routers, 5G nodes and everything in between should be considered insecure. Even if Huawei were planning to install sophisticated, hardware backdoors in its Australia-bound 5G components, just about every threat model out there already takes that as a given. As long as you properly encrypt data at rest and in transit, problem (mostly) solved.</p><p>Which leads me to Australia's decision late last year - with the support of the opposition - to rush through anti-encryption legislation that I described at the time as "at best useless and at worst downright dangerous".</p><p>Essentially, a country so paranoid about being hacked by foreign entities that it would ban an entire company with no track record of spying decided to weaken the best method of defending against such attacks: encryption. Properly encrypting data in transit means that even if it is intercepted at some point along the way, it won't be of any use.</p><p>But Australia's <em>Assistance and Access Bill</em>(AAB) requires companies, on request, to implement backdoors (which the bad guys will eventually also discover), preventing Australian companies from being able to guarantee such a service (the AAB only applies to products used or sold in Australia).</p><p>As Apple <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/technology/australia-cellphone-encryption-security.html">wrote</a> in its statement submitted to the Australian Parliament's Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on 12 October 2018:</p><blockquote>"Encryption is simply math... Any process that weakens the mathematical models that protect user data for anyone will by extension weaken the protections for everyone."</blockquote><p>The motto of the Australian government seems to be if you don't understand something, just ban it.</p><p>Don't understand encryption and its importance for millions of people, but worry that a couple of malicious individuals might use it to organise an attack? Just ban it.</p><p>Don't understand risk models or how to properly secure communications, but worry about China spying through one of its multinational 5G suppliers? Just ban it.</p><p>But weakening encryption creates unintended consequences. As I predicted at the time:</p><blockquote>"The Australian technology sector will suffer, but it will be largely unseen. Just the existence of the AAB means clients outside of Australia cannot be sure their data are secure. Australian coders and tech entrepreneurs will increasingly have to move overseas."</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, three months since the bill passed it seems <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/fastmail-loses-customers-faces-calls-to-move-over-anti-encryption-laws-519783">I was spot on</a>:</p><blockquote>"Hosted email provider FastMail says it has lost customers and faces "regular” requests to shift its operations outside Australia following the passage of anti-encryption laws. <br><br>The Victorian company, which offers ad-free email services to users in 150 countries, told a senate committee that the now-passed laws were starting to bite."</blockquote><p>Australian companies are losing customers because of the <strong>possibility </strong>of encryption backdoors, regardless of whether or not that is the case in practice (and we'll never know). No one can be sure which companies have been requested to undermine their clients' data security, so all of them get tarred with the same brush. The AAB has created what economists call an adverse selection problem, the end result of which may be the exit of companies unwilling to weaken their data security practices, or the collapse of related industries entirely.</p><p>Thankfully my other predictions haven't come to fruition - yet (although as far as I'm aware no criminal apprehensions as a direct result of the AAB have occurred).</p><p>But as the <a href="http://fortune.com/2019/02/18/australia-parliament-hack/">recent hack of Parliament</a> and all of the major parties highlights, uncompromised encryption is as important as ever both at home and at work.</p><p>The number of connected devices ("internet of things" or IoT) is only going to grow, and they are going to vary enormously in terms of how secure they are. The more devices, the more opportunities for malicious actors to compromise them. The best way to ensure that data are secure is to encrypt it at rest and in transit, so if there were a compromised device or 5G node somewhere along the chain it wouldn't matter.</p><p>If the government were truly worried about Chinese spying, it would encourage more encryption, not less.</p><p>But alas the politicians who, during the recent breach of their own servers, were very likely saved by the same encryption technology they just undermined, refuse to notice the potentially devastating unintended consequences of their actions. And why would they? If something bad happens as a result, they can always just ban it.</p><h3 id="new-frontiers">New frontiers</h3><p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-integrated-5g-959355/">Qualcomm promises first chipset with integrated 5G coming in 2020</a> »</p><p>Every phone with 5G capabilities today, e.g. the new Samsung and Huawei folding phones, use a separate chipset and modem combination. That drains a phone's battery a bit more than if they were combined - which is exactly the direction in which manufacturers are moving. As I said last week, wait for the third-generation 5G folding phones; the first and second gen are expensive and will have constant issues that need ironing out.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18239508/sprint-5g-launch-may-chicago-dallas-atlanta">Sprint’s 5G network launches in May</a> »</p><p>5G is coming in 2019, although the exact details are still a closely guarded secret. Don't rush into a 5G device; as with manufacturers, it will take the telecoms at least a couple of years to get the stability and reliability needed to supplant 4G (note that Sprint are already getting speeds ~10x faster than 4G, or about 430Mbps).</p><h3 id="news-aggregation">News aggregation</h3><p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/25/mozilla-and-scroll-partner-to-test-alternative-funding-models-for-the-web/">Mozilla and Scroll partner to test alternative funding models for the web</a> »</p><p>People like aggregation (e.g. Facebook) as it makes their lives easier.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been a lot of talk lately about 5G (5th generation mobile internet), both from positive (technological) and negative (political) points of view.</p><p>On the tech side, Samsung last week <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/samsung-reveals-5g-folding-phone-519615">unveiled</a> its folding phone, equipped with a 5G modem, to mixed reviews. The reviews were mixed, not because of the phone's 5G capabilities but because there are doubts as to whether people are ready to pay $US1,980 for a phone (Huawei's more impressive foldable phone, the Mate X, was announced on Monday with a price of $2,600!). Fair enough, too, but early adopters will always pay a steep price to essentially beta test new technology before it becomes mainstream. My prediction? Samsung (and Huawei) won't sell many folding phones but once the kinks in the technology are ironed out, production costs come down and the likes of Apple catch up, folding phones will become the norm (I'm talking at least 5 years here).</p><p>Then on the political side there's China's Huawei and its 5G hardware, which is copping plenty of heat. But more on that in a bit; I'm going to start with the positives.</p><p>The technology that underpins 5G is, without a doubt, going mainstream in the next 3 - 5 years. It's up to 100 times faster than 4G, has reduced latency ("ping"), can better handle simultaneous connections, uses less energy and is cheaper to maintain (Ericsson estimates it's <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/telecom/1476589/ericsson-boss-urges-proactive-5g-approach">~10 times cheaper than 4G</a>). No wonder then that telecommunication companies are rolling out infrastructure at breakneck speeds, with an <a href="https://www.ctia.org/news/race-to-5g-report">Analysys Mason report</a> finding that China, South Korea and the United States are leading the race, with China holding a narrow lead.</p><p>While relatively lower prices, faster browsing speeds and less video buffering when on the road will be nice, the real hype centres around will be built on the back of 5G: namely, an expansion of the "internet of things" (IoT), from smart fridges to fully automated vehicles.</p><p>The fact is the existing 4G network just can't handle the stress that a fully integrated IoT network would place on it. Today, the IoT is mostly in-home and connects to the internet via (often-insecure) home WiFi, transmitted over traditional fixed-line broadband. While 5G will not necessarily change that model, it does have the potential to do so. For example, given the lower cost and increase efficiencies, 5G will allow for far more devices - from home appliances to vending machines to every motor vehicle - to bypass the home network entirely, communicating directly to the cellular airwaves.</p><p>And therein lies the political problem.</p><p>The United States' government worries that the Chinese government, through its influence over China's leading 5G technology companies such as Huawei, will "backdoor" the hardware in order to facilitate espionage. As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-usa-pompeo/us-wont-partner-with-countries-that-use-huawei-systems-pompeo-idUSKCN1QA1O6">warned last week</a>:</p><blockquote>"If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them, we won’t be able to work alongside them... We’re not going to put American information at risk."</blockquote><p>Those concerns led the Australian government to ban Huawei from its developing 5G network, likely increasing the costs and reducing the quality of the network. While in Australia's case making 5G more expensive makes <em>political</em>sense - its struggling National Broadband Network (NBN) will have to compete with 5G in a few years - that's not the case for the other "five eyes", the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada, none of which have forbidden Huawei from 5G.</p><p>Incidentally, the United States itself hasn't banned Huawei and Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1098583029713420288">tweeted</a> his support for competition, not prohibition in the 5G space:</p><blockquote>"I want the United States to win [5G] through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do, especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology!"</blockquote><p>Whatever the case, the concerns about Huawei are overblown, for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>It's not in Huawei's, or the Chinese government's, interest to backdoor its 5G equipment, as the ramifications of getting caught would be severe;</li><li>If the Chinese government wanted to spy on foreigners, there is lower hanging, harder-to-detect fruit to poison (e.g. the IoT devices themselves!); and</li><li>Information should really be secured (encrypted) at the device and transport levels, meaning even if something were intercepted it wouldn't be of any use.</li></ul><p>Thankfully for consumers, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre has determined that there are ways to limit the risks from using Huawei in its 5G network. Similarly, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Germany-follows-UK-in-casting-doubt-on-US-Huawei-ban">Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-18/new-zealand-says-china-s-huawei-hasn-t-been-ruled-out-of-5g-role">New Zealand</a> have not ruled Huawei out as a 5G equipment provider.</p><p>The real reason Huawei is being singled out is political in nature, not technological. Silicon Valley is well aware that the likes of Huawei are currently ahead of American companies such as Cisco in the 5G space. Hyping up national security concerns and pressuring governments into banning Huawei is nothing more than an attempt to advantage American companies without resorting to messy trade barriers.</p><h3 id="new-frontiers">New frontiers</h3><p><a href="https://outline.com/fNyAzS">UK says Huawei is manageable risk to 5G</a> »</p><p>The United States warns its allies not to use Huawei, so Australia bans the Chinese company and world-leader in the 5G space. I'm glad to see there are still a few level heads in the United Kingdom (and elsewhere).<br><br>Incidentally, 5G is moving fast but as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18231221/qualcomm-x55-5g-modem-7gbps-speed-capacity-release-date-specs">this article</a> points out, it'll still be a while until 5G-enabled phones start to show up <em>en masse</em>. Given people are holding on to their existing smartphones <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43ejej/study-smartphone-iphone-trade-in-age-apple-event-2018">longer than ever</a>, 5G isn't anywhere near mainstream adoption.</p><p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/2186494/how-huawei-went-small-time-trader-shenzhen-worlds-biggest-telecoms">How Huawei went from small-time trader in Shenzhen to world’s biggest telecoms equipment supplier</a> »</p><p>A good article about Huawei's origins.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good morning and welcome to Issue 11/2019! It seems we can't go a week without another case of NIMBY-ism (Not In My BackYard) rearing its ugly head, this time in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html">New York</a>:</p><blockquote>"Amazon on Thursday canceled its plans to build an expansive corporate campus in New York City after facing an unexpectedly fierce backlash from some lawmakers and union leaders, who contended that a tech giant did not deserve nearly $3 billion in government incentives." <br><br>"A number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward," Amazon said in a statement.</blockquote><p>It appears as though a small minority of politicians - namely <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1096117499492478977">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her socialist cronies</a> - managed to sufficiently dissuade Amazon from opening its campus in New York.</p><p>I'm mixed about the decision. On the one hand, I loathe corporate welfare and subsidies. But on the other hand, good on Amazon for refusing to tolerate what was going to be a long period of harassment by a small group of vocal politicians. However, I think on net the decision is bad for both Amazon and New York City, because:</p><ul><li>Amazon doesn't get its campus, so for now it will have to look elsewhere as it builds "<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/14/tech/amazon-hq2-statement/index.html">a presence in New York over time</a>"; and</li><li>New York City loses out on tens (<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-and-mayor-de-blasio-announce-amazon-selects-long-island-city-new-corporate">hundreds?</a>) of thousands of jobs and billions in taxation revenue. The <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/12/05/despite-political-opposition-queens-voters-seem-to-like-amazon-deal-728529">people of Queens</a> actually <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/new-york-city/release-detail?ReleaseID=2589">wanted it to happen</a>.</li></ul><p>My understanding is that the direct subsidies amounted to ~$505 million, with the rest of the quoted $3 billion resulting from city/state tax concessions through schemes available to all businesses. Don't get me wrong, the $505 million should never have been offered given that Amazon would have grown its presence in New York for free (and still will, albeit more slowly). But just because it wasn't the "best" possible deal doesn't suddenly make it a bad deal. A few rotten apples really have ruined this for everyone (except for Virginia and other regions where Amazon might now expand instead).</p><p>However, where Amazon <strong>really</strong> erred was with its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/as-amazon-narrows-choice-for-hq2these-cities-finishing-strong.html">highly publicised</a>"competition" to select a site, pitting cities against each other when it was always going to select New York. The whole charade was nothing but an attempt to get itself some sweet, sweet corporate welfare and now it has blown up in its face. Bezos has no one to blame but himself.</p><p>Anyway, enough about Amazon.</p><h3 id="new-frontiers">New frontiers</h3><p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/enough-5g-hype">Enough of the 5G Hype</a> »</p><p>In an ideal world, FTTH would be the standard for home broadband. Unfortunately, not a single human being lives in that world. We have these things called politicians with their own ideas and interests, which often move in very different directions to that ideal. So while FTTH would be great, 5G is infinitely cheaper to deploy and doesn't have the same regulatory hurdles. That's a winner in my books.</p><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/startup-grind-stripe-valued-at-23-billion-has-no-plans-to-ipo-says-ceo-8fa261f7b136">Stripe valued at $23 billion and has no plans to IPO, says CEO</a> »</p><p>There's always space for improvement, no matter how small it may seem. Coincidentally, John's brother Patrick was on Russ Roberts' <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/patrick-collison-on-innovation-and-scientific-progress/">Econtalk podcast</a> the other day discussing technological progress (not affiliated with EconByte).

I'm very interested to see how this develops; subscription-based news aggregators haven't had much success in the past so I'm firmly on the sceptical side of the fence (I also won't be subscribing).</p><h3 id="social-media">Social media</h3><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/11/reddit-users-are-the-least-valuable-of-any-social-network.html">Reddit users are the least valuable of any social network</a> »</p><p>I don't think so. As regular readers know, I'm no fan of the advertising model, but I don't have a better model (yet!). Reddit has been around for a while, but came close to death under the mismanagement of former CEO Ellen Pao. It's a different beast now and its ARPU will only rise from here (Reddit has a LOT of duplicate accounts, fyi), so Tencent's $150 million - remember this is a company with a market value of over US$500 billion - is probably not a bad punt.</p><h3 id="rideshare">Rideshare</h3><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/15/18226599/uber-nyc-driver-cap-lawsuit-de-blasio">Uber sues to overturn New York City’s cap on new ride-hail drivers</a> »</p><p>From the city that brought you rent controls and "socialist" politicians willing to cut off the nose to spite the face (read the Amazon feature above) comes restrictions on rideshare companies. If you ever needed an example of politicians acting against their constituents' interests, look no further than New York City.</p><h3 id="china">China</h3><p><a href="https://beta.scmp.com/tech/gear/article/2185661/apple-and-xiaomi-shipments-plunge-china-huawei-bucking-slump-industry">Apple iPhone shipments plunge in China with Huawei gaining ground against wider industry slump</a> »</p><p>It's true that the Chinese economy is slowing, but that's not why Apple is losing ground. Compared to its Chinese rivals, Apple just can't get away with the 'iPhone tax' in China anymore (neither can Samsung). If it's really worried about losing market share in China, it needs to improve its product or lower its prices.<br><br>Incidentally, the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2186350/chinas-loans-hit-all-time-high-banks-open-floodgates-january">credit floodgates</a> have just been opened in China, which should help Apple in the short-term.</p><h3 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h3><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/jp-morgan-is-rolling-out-the-first-us-bank-backed-cryptocurrency-to-transform-payments--.html">JP Morgan is rolling out the first US bank-backed cryptocurrency to transform payments business</a> »</p><p>To be fair, 'JPM Coins' are a completely different kettle of fish to most of the cryptocurrencies we know.

Let me explain:</p><p>Rather than producing two different products twice a week - the Monday morning in-depth article and Friday's <em>Assorted bits</em> - I decided to amalgamate the two into one update, set to arrive in your mailbox every Tuesday or Wednesday morning.</p><p>Why the change? Believe it or not, my day job takes up a fair bit of my time. Writing this newsletter along with various hobbies, a couple of huskies and a wife doesn't exactly leave that much time to compile the EconByte website and newsletter.</p><p>So from now on, every Issue of EconByte will have a similar format to this update, with something I've written at the top, followed by a collection of interesting articles I've read, topped off with an image (usually a chart, but not always).

I stand by that and still believe that "regulating Facebook would be a win for Facebook, regulators, politicians, lawyers, accountants, content screeners, the NSA, etc., but would represent a large unseen loss for consumers who will be stuck with Facebook and its data abuse for far longer than they should".</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18213567/twitter-to-stop-sharing-mau-as-users-decline-q4-2018-earnings">Twitter keeps losing monthly users, so it’s going to stop sharing how many</a> »</p><p>Twitter is in trouble, but not in the way that say Facebook would be if its active user growth were declining. Twitter has a loyal, established userbase but I just can't see it ever going as "global" as the other social networks, given at the end of the day all it does is publish text messages on the internet. When it had the opportunity to do so, it was too slow to react and so missed the Instagram (images) and YouTube (video) boat. Competitors such as Reddit are nipping at its heels.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/technology/facebook-china-internet.html">How Facebook's Tiny China Sales Floor Helps Generate Big Ad Money</a> »</p><p>Facebook won't be able to grow its user base forever. It's an advertising company and due to the Great Firewall, China is still an emerging frontier for such businesses. 10% of total revenue is huge, and it will continue to grow... until the government bans them to help out a local competitor, that is.</p><p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/acccs-rod-sims-to-maintain-pressure-on-google-and-facebook-20190208-p50wip.html">ACCCs Rod Sims to maintain pressure on Google and Facebook</a> »</p><p>What an incredibly linear, static view to hold as the head of a <strong>competition </strong>bureau. How does Sims know that 2006 had the optimal number of 'news producers', given the arrival of news aggregators such as Facebook? If something is "commercially focused and highly effective", what does the competition regulator care?

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Economics blogger Scott Sumner, with whom I disagree on monetary policy (that’s a story for another day), brings up an important issue in a recent <a href="https://www.econlib.org/the-gig-economy-minimum-wages-and-unemployment/">blog post</a>. Namely, that the unintended consequence of regulations designed to help rideshare drivers is to solidify Uber’s status at the top of the food chain. Sumner writes:</p><blockquote>“Soon after the ride sharing companies began breaking up the government-created taxi cartels, the regulators struck back by applying minimum wage laws to drivers—even though they are independent contractors… [But] how do we determine the number of hours worked? Is it hours spent in the car, or hours spent actually driving customers? The regulators opted for hours spent in the car. But many drivers work for more than one company—so who pays for the downtime? The regulators decided to split the cost evenly, a practice that favors Uber over its competitors.”</blockquote><p>How do the regulations favour Uber over its smaller competitors? <a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/02/uber-lyft-taxi-minimum-wage-ride-hailing-drivers-new-york/581707/">Citylab</a> explains:</p><blockquote>“Because Uber is bigger, drivers are most likely to be called to drive for them first. But all the dead time on the app counts against smaller companies like Lyft and Juno, even if drivers aren’t picking up rides… <br><br>According to Juno’s filing, the TLC tried to address this in a December revision to the rule by splitting the idle time evenly between each company. “Far from fixing the Rule’s flaws,” Juno wrote, “this new methodology exacerbates them by disproportionately harming companies like Juno”—a fairly new competitor in the market that relies on drivers already hooked on Uber and Lyft, but that offers more flexibility by freeing them from ride quotas.”</blockquote><p>I’ve been critical of those seeking to regulate Facebook in the past, for precisely the same reasons. Regulations often help established workers, businesses and monopolists, as they are better equipped to design, comply and work with or around them. The losers are consumers, smaller competitors and yet-to-be-conceived market entrants.</p><p>Occupational licensing does not improve quality or public health and safety, but does raise prices for consumers and the wages of those who manage to enter licensed occupations, at the expense of other workers (~28% more, according to the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/licensing_report_final_nonembargo.pdf">Obama Administration’s report</a> on the issue). Land use regulation increases house prices, benefitting those already in the market at the expense of renters and those considering home ownership. The following image is from recent Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2018/pdf/rdp2018-03.pdf">research</a>, which estimated that land use zoning restrictions adds ~$489,000 to the price of a detached house in Sydney in 2016, ~$324,000 in Melbourne, ~$159,000 in Brisbane and ~$206,000 in Perth (HT: <a href="https://theconversation.com/rba-research-shows-that-zoning-restrictions-are-driving-up-housing-prices-93064">The Conversation</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/zoning-cost-by-city.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/zoning-cost-sydney.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The effect of land use zoning is the same everywhere in the world, with house prices most pronounced in places people want to live that also have the most intense artificial supply constraints (e.g. San Francisco, Boston, Sydney, Vancouver, Hong Kong… the list goes on).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/land-regulations-house-prices-world.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Textbook (optimal) regulation can be good, but the political process rarely produces such outcomes. Regulation is designed and determined in political, not economic, markets. The likes of Uber and Facebook are not unchecked natural monopolies by any definition, but operate in a highly competitive market where no one’s longevity is guaranteed. As an article on the aptly-named “startup grind” <a href="https://medium.com/startup-grind/what-makes-a-social-network-successful-a-data-driven-investigation-f62a36c05f4e">points out</a>, “for every Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there’s a Friendster, Pownce, or Color Labs”.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/failed-social-media-companies-1.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>If the experience of rideshare regulation above is anything to go by, the political system will more likely than not fail in its attempt to efficiently regulate Facebook or any other technology company currently operating in a competitive market. But that’s not even the biggest problem with regulating technology companies.</p><p>As with the rideshare case above, if (when?) unintended consequences rear their ugly heads, regulators will be obliged to fix them with - you guessed it - more regulation, which may create further unintended consequences, requiring …you get the idea. Once an industry is regulated, it becomes incredibly difficult to unwind that regulation given the interests that will grow under the new regime and the political forces that work to keep them in place.</p><p>My point is that even if there were some “optimal regulation” that could be applied to Facebook (and others) that would move the sector towards something more closely resembling a textbook version of a perfectly competitive world, we should err on the side of caution. The technology sector is already highly competitive, meaning any social gains - even from optimal regulation - would likely be small. However, the costs of getting it wrong could be enormously high, making everyone worse off than if there had been no regulation in the first place.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has been on a bit of a downward spiral for several months now, with the latest controversy concerning how many users it actually has. It’s a valid question, with Facebook’s rate of growth so consistent it’s scary, to the extent that when I plotted a linear trend against Facebook’s quarterly change in active users it was literally a flat line.</p><p>Facebook’s share price followed a similar trajectory up until July 2018, when Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/business/facebook-stock-earnings-call.html">reported</a> disappointing second-quarter earnings and a negative sales growth outlook. In percentage terms, growth in the number of active users has fallen to an all-time low, and in absolute terms it’s now the lowest since September 2014.</p><p>The poor result was the first sign that Facebook’s clients - companies buying Facebook’s algorithms and marketing their products to the supposed ever-growing number of eyeballs on its website - were beginning to lose faith in the advertising behemoth. Investors were understandably worried, and their concerns led to Facebook’s share price taking a big dive. But Facebook’s problems run deeper than a reported slowdown in active user growth.</p><h3 id="losing-the-plot">Losing the plot</h3><p>According to a <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/facebook.html">recent 70-page report</a> by a former Harvard classmate of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (note that, understandably, Facebook <a href="https://www.ccn.com/facebook-billion-fake-account-zuckerberg-con-man/">disputes its findings</a>):</p><blockquote>“Facebook has been lying to the public about the scale of its problem with fake accounts, which likely exceed 50% of its network. Its official metrics—many of which it has stopped reporting quarterly—are self-contradictory and even farcical. The company has lost control of its own product.”</blockquote><p>It continues:</p><blockquote>“…documents recently revealed show that since 2012, management has worried about where it can find more warm bodies to sign on. Fake accounts have been keeping the company that Columbia professor Tim Wu has called an “attention merchant” afloat. The cost of Zuckerberg’s dissembling, dating all the way back to 2004, has accrued, and is finally coming due. Accordingly, it is increasingly likely that Facebook will go the way of AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy—if legal liability doesn’t bankrupt it first.”</blockquote><p>True or not, the report is consistent with a growing amount of anecdotal evidence, the most recent being reports that companies are starting to move away from Facebook and back to more traditional mediums such as TV. As revealed <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/addressable-tv-budgets-move-away-facebook/">last Thursday</a>:</p><blockquote>“…the inversion isn’t solely due to how fed up brands are with the social network; it’s also down to the emergence of an addressable alternative on TV. <br><br>Duracell… discovered that a large portion of the video ads it bought on the social network in the U.K. weren’t being viewed. [So] rather than try to focus on more expensive, but viewable impressions, Duracell decided to divert the money it had spent back to TV, a large portion of which went toward on-demand content.”</blockquote><p>Fake-user scams seem to be popping up on Facebook on a regular basis. A very average American band called Threatin managed to amass 38,000 likes on its Facebook page, convincing a number of venues in the United Kingdom that it had an active fanbase and had toured extensively in the US. According to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/12/threatin-band-fake-fanbase-tour">Guardian</a>, the stunt “has done nothing but fleece several UK venues out of money and time that would be far better spent on genuine artists.”</p><p>The scam was made possible by so-called “click-farms”, where you can buy likes and comments for your products. They are <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/121551/bot-bubble-click-farms-have-inflated-social-media-currency">big business</a> these days, and Facebook is powerless - or simply unwilling - to stop the onslaught of fake accounts. As one of the click-farm operators <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/click-farms-social-media-1b26841c7991">exclaims</a>, “Every system is made by humans, so there is always a way to beat it”.</p><p>Given that Facebook charges its customers based on impressions and clicks, not their actual conversion ratio (people buying their products), having a large number of fake users that click on real, paid-for advertising is actually a big deal. If that trend continues for long enough, and conversion ratios remain low enough, I expect to see even more advertisers follow Duracell back to TV, or as was the case for the <a href="https://digiday.com/media/new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/">New York Times</a>, ending the use of ad exchanges and behavioural targeting altogether.</p><h3 id="lingering-questions">Lingering questions</h3><p>Even if Facebook is telling the truth about the number of fake users on its platform, it needs to answer the question as to why it’s not delivering conversions for its customers, and to date it hasn’t been able to. Late last year a group of small advertisers even <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lawsuit-facebook-lied-about-video-metrics-misled-advertisers">sued Facebook</a>, claiming it overstated the amount of time users spent watching videos by up to 900%.</p><p>The only thing we know for sure is that Facebook lies, constantly. Whether it’s lying about video metrics, page <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/10/16/facebook-lured-advertisers-by-inflating-ad-watch-times-up-to-900-percent-lawsuit/%20900">post reach</a>, or what it does with its users’ data, it has a solid track record of deception. So why would we expect it to behave any differently with click-farms and fake accounts?</p><p>Once the “best place to work in America”, Facebook has fallen to #7 in Glassdoor’s annual survey, the first time since 2015 its score has worsened. And it wasn’t because of things like compensation and benefits, on which it still ranks highly, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/04/facebook-is-no-longer-glassdoors-best-place-to-work.html">but</a> “continued scandals and the increased bureaucracy that comes with the maturing of any tech company”.</p><p>Companies are less eager to advertise on Facebook as it fails to deliver on its promises. Its stated rate of growth in active monthly users is dubious at best. Its own employees are increasingly looking elsewhere for employment. And its CEO is a raging lunatic. Knowing all of that, why would anyone buy Facebook?</p><h3 id="what-s-next-for-facebook">What’s next for Facebook</h3><p>In a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facts-about-facebook-11548374613">Wall Street Journal op-ed</a> last week titled “The Facts About Facebook”, CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit back at Facebook’s critics by stating:</p><blockquote>“This [advertising] model can feel opaque, and we’re all distrustful of systems we don’t understand. Sometimes this means people assume we do things that we don’t do. For example, we don’t sell people’s data, even though it’s often reported that we do. In fact, selling people’s information to advertisers would be counter to our business interests, because it would reduce the unique value of our service to advertisers. We have a strong incentive to protect people’s information from being accessed by anyone else.”</blockquote><p>The thing is, people are finally beginning to understand how Facebook works, and that’s Facebook’s problem. They don’t trust it because they <strong>do</strong> understand how it works. Just because the CEO with a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/the-face-of-facebook">history of shady dealings</a> that no one trusts argues a technicality, doesn’t mean it ain’t so.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/zuckerberg-dumb-email-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Zuckerberg is right that it would be against Facebook’s interest to sell people’s data. But he’s being deceptive. Facebook collects, aggregates and then sells the insights generated to companies to help them optimise their adverts. Facebook’s users are still a commodity and their data and privacy are treated as such, whether it is directly “sold” or not.</p><p>So where does that leave Facebook? People are growing tired of its dated, invasive business model, but it doesn’t really have anything new on the horizon. I doubt very much that, knowing all of Facebook’s privacy issues, people are going super keen to have a “Portal” to Facebook in their homes, which Facebook describes as a “connected smart camera that lets you video chat with the ones you love”. Nice try, Mark.</p><p>The only other “innovation” on the cards is the amalgamation of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. As most of you are probably aware, Facebook owns both Instagram and WhatsApp but to date it hasn’t done much to integrate them into the main Facebook platform. That might be about to change, with Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/25/facebook-instagram-encryption-integration/">announcing</a> that it plans to do just that by early 2020. However, somewhat surprisingly its first step will be to add end-to-end encryption to Instagram messages and encrypting Messenger by default (currently you have to opt in).</p><h3 id="an-act-of-desperation">An act of desperation</h3><p>Now colour me sceptical, but I’m not sure why Facebook would be doing this unless it’s going to backdoor the encryption. Yes it could rely solely on metadata analysis, but that’s not nearly as lucrative as being able to analyse entire messages. Maybe it’s a public relations exercise, along the lines of “see, encryption, we care about your privacy”, but Facebook wouldn’t do anything that might jeopardise its bottom line; it needs as much of your data as possible to improve its advertising algorithms.</p><p>A backdoor would be easy enough to accomplish and users of its services wouldn’t even know. For while WhatsApp’s encryption is built on the open-source Signal protocol, WhatsApp itself is closed-source, meaning there’s no way for the user to know whether or not Facebook retained a copy of your or your contact’s private key for itself.</p><p>Adding fuel to the speculative backdoor fire is the fact that the founders of both Instagram and WhatsApp exited Facebook in recent months, with the latter <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-whatsapp-brian-acton/whatsapp-co-founder-acton-flags-tensions-with-zuckerberg-forbes-idUSKCN1M61RQ">citing disagreements</a> with Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg over how to monetise the messaging service. Facebook paid $19 billion for WhatsApp in 2014 and has yet to figure out how to monetise it in any significant way, and may never be able to. Unlike Facebook and Instagram, there are secure substitutes for WhatsApp, such as <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> and <a href="https://wire.com/en/">Wire</a>.</p><h3 id="critical-human">Critical human</h3><p>Personally, I think it’s an act of desperation; a sign that Facebook has completely lost the plot in terms of what to do next. I’m leaning toward the theory that Facebook has reached “critical human”, with its reported active user growth mostly derived from fake accounts. With some creative tracking metrics, bringing WhatsApp and Instagram into the Facebook ecosystem might enable it to inflate its active user numbers by double-counting people from multiple platforms. As an added bonus, it can try to pull the wool over the eyes of its users and regulators by feigning concern for user privacy through end-to-end encryption (which may not be backdoored, but probably will be).</p><p>But now that the rot has begun it will be hard to stop. People understand how Facebook works and are either spending less time on the platform or quitting altogether. How Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook react will be crucial in determining Facebook’s future: is it here to stay, or will it join MySpace and countless other once glorious social network experiments on the internet’s scrap heap?</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I often write about the flaws of Facebook, Google and other Silicon Valley “unicorns” (companies with one billion+ valuations), but I don’t talk enough about the economic realities of their persistence. Economists are fond of the phrase “there is no such thing as a free lunch”, and it’s as true for the tech unicorns as it is elsewhere. It’s easy to point out flaws and potential improvements from the outside, but the fact is those alternatives come with their own costs.</p><h3 id="the-nirvana-fallacy">The nirvana fallacy</h3><p>Coined by Harold Demsetz in 1969, the nirvana fallacy describes a situation where some ideal solution is pitted against the flawed status quo, often with the full costs of that ideal omitted. As <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/724977">Demsetz</a> put it:</p><blockquote>“The view that now pervades much public policy economics implicitly presents the relevant choice as between an ideal norm and an existing ‘imperfect’ institutional arrangement. This nirvana approach differs considerably from a comparative institution approach in which the relevant choice is between alternative real institutional arrangements. In practice, those who adopt the nirvana viewpoint seek to discover discrepancies between the ideal and the real and if discrepancies are found, they deduce that the real is inefficient.”</blockquote><p>In my opinion, Facebook is an example of an imperfect institutional arrangement. But that doesn’t mean it’s inefficient, given how imperfect the alternatives are. Have you ever tried GNU social, Diaspora*, Friendica or Pump.io? I have, and let me tell you that for the average punter they are not even close to becoming Facebook equivalents. I love that they exist, but they fill a geeky niche that is entirely different to Facebook’s one-size-fits-all model.</p><p>The same can be said for regulating Facebook. Proponents point out all of the flaws in the existing arrangement, but compare it to an ideal state where internet companies are perfectly regulated to a point where they safeguard their users’ data while simultaneously sell it. It’s just not possible, even if we ignore all of the flaws in the political process such as lobbying, rent-seeking and regulatory capture.</p><p>The reason Facebook persists is because its users like it more than the alternative options available to them right now.</p><h3 id="switching-costs">Switching costs</h3><p>People hate switching, because it costs them the most important resource of all: <strong>time</strong>. Even if there were a Facebook alternative that ticks all of the boxes, people would be reluctant to expend time and effort researching it, convincing their friends to join, and so on. Switching costs apply to everything, from social networks to car insurance. For example, <em>Energy Consumers Australia</em> undertakes a monthly survey, with one of the questions being: “Which of the following have you ever done?”.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/switching-costs-dec-18-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>It turns out that Australians don’t switch energy providers very often, with 43.9% of the surveyed population having <strong>never</strong> switched their gas or electricity providers. As a result, CHOICE <a href="https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/shopping-for-services/utilities/articles/energy-comparison-sites">estimates</a> that Australian energy consumers are paying about $400 too much every year, with Australian households as a whole paying about an additional $1.2 billion every year. Competition is great, but unless the alternative is significantly better or the switching costs are sufficiently low, people will stick with their existing service providers.</p><p>That makes the case of the Silicon Valley unicorns all the more interesting. How much do you pay for Google searches? Your Facebook profile? Scrolling your Twitter feed? Reading a review on Yelp? Sending a Snap? For most people, the answer is $0.</p><p>All of the companies I mentioned above derive their revenues from advertising, and by now it’s common knowledge that they take your data and monetise it. But even knowing that, less than 5% of Facebook users care enough to bother changing their privacy settings, and the average user would want more than $1,000 to deactivate their account for a year.</p><p>Switching costs are very real and they make it difficult for an individual to change providers, especially when they currently pay nothing (in dollar terms).</p><p>Google <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/06/30/google-cost-585-million-to-build-or-what-rupert-paid-for-myspace/#334dcc3b61d8">spent $560 million</a> on its social network, Google Plus, yet ultimately failed because the switching costs were too great (its product wasn’t good enough to offset them). While a competitor with a different, non-advertising business model might have a better chance if it can offer users value greater than the switching costs, that ideal alternative doesn’t yet exist.</p><h3 id="blockchain-meet-reality">Blockchain, meet reality</h3><p>Perhaps the most recent example of the cost of change is that of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underpins them, which was hailed as a revolution that would not only replace existing, fiat currencies, but would change banking as we know it. No longer would people need to rely on centralised bastions of trust; instead, a decentralised, trustless ledger would allow transactions to be processed for a fraction of the cost.</p><p>But as the fog of euphoria parted, it became clear that the technology was not even close to achieving its lofty goals. A number of papers are <a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/no-such-thing-as-a-free-ledger/">starting to emerge</a> that highlight the costs involved in using a blockchain ledger. As Arnold Kling <a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/no-such-thing-as-a-free-ledger/">wrote recently</a>:</p><blockquote>“…you cannot just look at the costs imposed by centralized record-keepers and say ‘all those costs just go away with blockchain.’ Other costs are introduced.”</blockquote><p>It’s important to bear the nirvana fallacy and the cost of change in mind whenever the next latest and greatest technology is discovered. Today’s institutional arrangements exist for a reason and to successfully disrupt them a competitor will need to first overcome the hefty switching costs, a task easier said than done. As a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1086738156840308736">Twitter thread</a> highlighted:</p><ul><li>Uber launched by going to black car companies and paying drivers to be available on Uber during certain hours, ensuring that riders would be able to find a ride.</li><li>Relationship Hero, a relationship coaching marketplace, scaled to dozens of customers with just one coach–its cofounder!

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been thinking for some time about how centralised many of the services we use on a daily basis really are. For example, for a true social network - that is, primarily text-based with a user’s content preserved but limited to “friends” only - you really only have Facebook. There are certainly alternatives but in terms of keeping in touch with a wide group of diverse associates, it’s Facebook or bust (curse those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effects</a>!).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/social-networks-by-active-users-oct18-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>But as I discussed last week, Facebook is not a monopoly in the true sense of the word. While Facebook itself might be entirely centralised, it operates in a decentralised environment where its position at the top of the food chain is fickle at best. As the late Harold Demsetz (1988) put it in <em>The Organization of Economic Activity: Ownership, Control and the Firm</em>:</p><blockquote>“The analytical usefulness of the concept of decentralization derives precisely from the fact that it allows the analyst to ignore the behavior of a single individual or a small group of individuals. It implicitly asserts that the tactical measures taken by incumbent firms to bar entrants from an industry cannot long hold at bay the continuous onslaught of more efficient organizations and techniques of production.”</blockquote><p>The only way Facebook can prevent entrants from eventually usurping it is by constantly improving, or through artificial barriers, which is precisely why regulators should keep clear (I really, really don’t want to be stuck with Facebook any longer than necessary).</p><h3 id="industry-concentration-is-the-new-normal">Industry concentration is the new normal</h3><p>But what I realised is that it’s not just social networks where a person’s choice is limited: banks; utilities; transport - both public and private (e.g. Uber/taxi) - universities; soft drinks (60% of the global non-alcoholic beverages industry is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060415/how-much-global-beverage-industry-controlled-coca-cola-and-pepsi.asp">controlled</a> by Coca-Cola and Pepsi); insurance; and even super markets, are all relatively concentrated. As this chart by <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/03/24/corporate-concentration">the Economist</a> shows, most sectors in the United States have become more concentrated since 1997.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/industry-concentration-by-sector.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>That’s not necessarily a bad thing; it might be optimal to have one or a few providers of a good or service instead of a number of smaller ones, and the relationship between industry concentration and higher profits all but disappears when firm size is taken into account (see for example Yale Brozen’s 1982 book <em>Concentration, Mergers, and Public Policy</em>).</p><h3 id="living-in-an-age-of-centralisation">Living in an age of centralisation</h3><p>But it does mean we are living in an age of centralisation, <strong>especially </strong>in the tech sector. I find it somewhat ironic that one of the most innovative, adaptive and decentralised (using Demsetz’s description above) sectors is also the one in which a few companies tend to dominate at a given task.</p><p>In the past, industry concentration wasn’t an issue because the firms were essentially direct service providers. Your bank charged you account fees, and/or lent out your deposits, to make a profit. Your internet provider, water and power utilities charge you a monthly fee based on some combination of fixed and usage charges. But that all changed with Google and its “free” services, a model later copied by Facebook and countless other start-ups around the world.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/defining-the-divide-tech.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Instead of charging you directly, they sell targeted access to you (or the means, via the data it stores about you, for some other entity to target you). Individually your data aren’t worth much, as Gregor Barber noted in a recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-sold-my-data-for-crypto/">Wired article</a> when trying to sell his Facebook data, but when you have more than a billion users you can start to do some funky things with their information (data scientist roles have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/12/11/linkedins-fastest-growing-jobs-today-are-in-data-science-machine-learning/#43f6451451bd">grown over 650%</a> since 2012).</p><blockquote>“My tipping point was the Facebook hack, exposed in September, in which I—along with some 90 million other potential victims—was temporarily locked out of my account. I imagined my identity rippling across the internet, thanks to the single sign-in convenience of Facebook Connect. After a long season of leaks, hacks, and shady data pillaging, I’d had enough. I considered simply deleting my account. But then I landed on a different strategy: making a profit. <br><br>…I was ready to call it quits—unless, that is, my proceeds reeled me back in. I tallied up my fiat (that’s money, to the rest of us): 162 WIB, 1 DAT, 0 NRN. My earnings, while eclectic, were worth approximately 0.3 cents.”</blockquote><h3 id="what-you-can-do-about-it">What you can do about it</h3><p>As Barber found out, a random individual’s Facebook data aren’t worth much, but Facebook’s centralised database clearly is (otherwise no one would pay for access). For now, free services paid for with targeted advertising tailored via “big data” stores of user information are the business model. It won’t be that way forever, but while it is there are some things you can do to protect yourself. Barber had a good suggestion:</p><blockquote>“My efforts had simply heightened my sense of just how much I was sharing, and made me inclined to expose a little less: to leave my phone at home when I went on a run, or to conceal my phone number and real email address from Facebook.”</blockquote><p>It’s safe to say that the likes of Facebook and Google already know a LOT about you. The list of data gathering techniques they employ are virtually endless, whether it’s direct collection through a combination your web searches, online purchases, music and video preferences, etc., or indirectly via your family, friends and co-workers’ data (so-called “<a href="https://theconversation.com/shadow-profiles-facebook-knows-about-you-even-if-youre-not-on-facebook-94804">shadow profiles</a>”).</p><p>Even if you’re being careful, they’re also able to “<a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">fingerprint</a>” your web browser and device, allowing them to track you when you don’t want to be tracked. Those Facebook “like” buttons at the end of a blog post? They’re specifically designed to track you and your web browsing activities, linking what you do while not on Facebook to your shadow profile. The list of tracking tools and techniques employed by these companies is ever-growing and evolving as their advertising business model depends upon knowing more about you than their competitors.</p><p>But for the vast majority of people - myself included! - your data are probably about as valuable to these firms as Gregor Barber’s above, i.e. not very. The best thing you can do is just not give it up so easily: change your privacy settings, block third-party cookies, use browser extensions that block trackers and switch to open source and/or encrypted alternatives where you can (for example, use <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> instead of Facebook Messenger and <a href="https://www.protonmail.ch/">ProtonMail</a> instead of GMail). If you sync your data into the cloud (e.g. with Dropbox), consider using something like <a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a> to encrypt it before it ever leaves your device.</p><p>Most importantly, use a password manager such as <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a>, secured with a strong passphrase and ideally a physical token (e.g. a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>). While the likes of Facebook and Google are as creepy as they come, for the average person your <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/your-security-plan">primary threat</a> will come from using a weak password on multiple websites or apps, exposing you to malicious actors seeking to hurt you financially (or worse).</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you follow EconByte then you’re probably aware of my dislike of Facebook and so I apologise in advance for yet another Facebook-related post. But in light of even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/facebook-messages-defense-spotify-netflix/">more revelations</a> of Facebook’s abuse of its user’s data, it may come as some surprise to see me, of all people, advocating <strong>against</strong> the regulation of Facebook. Hear me out.</p><h3 id="regulating-facebook-will-only-make-it-more-dominant">Regulating Facebook will only make it more dominant</h3><p>There’s a strong and growing impetus around the world to subject Facebook, and by proxy all other social media companies, to sterner regulation. For example, British politician Damian Collins issued a statement calling for authorities to investigate Facebook and for it to once again <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/uks-dcms-calls-in-facebook-again-over-user-data-access-asks-competition-authorities-to-investigate/">appear before his committee</a> to “explain how their policies work on access to user data, and whether policies are a breach of data privacy law, as it would appear that user data was made available to firms without the informed consent of the user having been given”.</p><p>Investigations are already underway both in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/05/amazon-facebook-google-are-all-being-looked-antitrust-violations-trump-says/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.73d0e0ed0a15">Washington</a> and <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-antitrust-facebook/german-antitrust-watchdog-plans-action-on-facebook-this-year-idUKKCN1LC17Z">Germany</a>, with both countries trying to determine whether or not Facebook is a monopoly and should be regulated as such. As Collins <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/chair-statement-17-19/">stated</a>:</p><blockquote>“Given the dominant market position they enjoy in social media, this gives real concerns about whether they are behaving as a monopoly, exercising their considerable power to further dominate the commercial environment in which they trade; making some businesses, and breaking others in the process.”</blockquote><p>Fair enough, too; Facebook is as creepy as they come. Even with location tracking turned off, Facebook <a href="https://gizmodo.com/turning-off-facebook-location-tracking-doesnt-stop-it-f-1831149148">uses</a> IP addresses, check-ins, and cities on profiles to approximate user locations for ads and other services. Then there are the bugs, such as the one where app developers were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/facebook-photo-bug/">mistakenly granted permission</a> to access the photos of up to 5.6 million users. Oh and who could forget its dodgy VPN application, supposedly developed to provide users with “greater privacy and control around their data”, but in reality was literally <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/23/apple-finally-takes-down-facebooks-vpn-spying-app.aspx">designed</a> to spy on people.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/facebook-privacy-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>That said, I would be surprised if regulators managed to define Facebook as a monopoly without somehow bending the rules. A <a href="https://www.unm.edu/~parkman/M15.pdf">popular economics textbook</a> by Greg Mankiw defines monopoly as “a firm that is the sole seller of a product without close substitutes… is a price maker… earns extraordinary profits for an extended period… price is greater than marginal cost… [and] market power is based on substantial barriers to entry”.</p><p>While there is no exact replica of Facebook, and certainly none with the network effects that it has developed over time, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites">plenty</a> of close substitutes. As for being a price maker, Facebook doesn’t even sell a product to consumers - it’s an advertising company and its users pay with data instead of dollars. The barriers to entry are also tiny; at the end of the day, Facebook is just another website and plenty of alternatives have come and gone throughout its existence.</p><h3 id="but-when-you-re-an-antitrust-lawyer-everything-s-a-monopoly-">But when you’re an antitrust lawyer, everything’s a monopoly.</h3><p>The enormous amount of media attention directed at Facebook and its morally opaque business model has resulted in all sorts of critters emerging from the woodwork, including antitrust lawyers. Former antitrust assistant attorney general Sally Hubbard, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/02/perspectives/big-tech-facebook-google-amazon-microsoft-antitrust/index.html">writing for CNN Business</a>, had this to say:</p><blockquote>“Facebook, for example, doesn’t need to have a monopoly over a market as broad as “all social media.” All social media platforms are not substitutes for Facebook. You can’t see baby pictures on LinkedIn, and you can’t keep in touch with Grandma on Twitter. The closest substitute to Facebook is Instagram, which isn’t much of a choice since Facebook owns it.”</blockquote><p>There’s plenty more in the article but it’s painful stuff. I mean, you can make any company into a monopoly if you narrow your definition of “market” enough. All electric vehicles are not substitutes for a Telsa. Monopoly! I control the market for EconByte posts. Monopoly!</p><p>But baby pictures, really? You want to see some distant associate’s baby pictures that badly, but not enough to accept Facebook’s conditions or I don’t know, ask them for a picture, that you would prefer to cry monopoly and drag Facebook through the courts?</p><p>As for grandma, if you truly wanted to keep in touch, why not call once in a while? Email? SMS? The possibilities are virtually endless. I would go on but the article is so dimwitted and ignorant of the subject with which it deals that I just can’t.</p><h3 id="politics-is-not-economics">Politics is not economics</h3><p>While Facebook may fail an economist’s definition of monopoly, good politics is not necessarily good economics (in fact, it <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3043.Is_Reality_Optional_and_Other_Essays">often runs contrary</a>). To a politician, Facebook is ripe for regulation and its constant exploitation of its user’s data has shaped up as the perfect justification.</p><p>But alas, without forcing it to change its business model entirely, regulating Facebook will do little to help its users and will in all likelihood further entrench its status as a monopoly.</p><p>A key problem with regulating Facebook as a monopoly is that it will require a myriad of generalised, industry-wide regulations. No doubt the end package will have a noble aim and name, with the Eurozone’s “General Data Protection Regulation” (GDPR) the most prominent example. But Facebook already operates in Europe and so has been subject to the GDPR even as the list of accusations against it continues to grow.</p><p>The sad fact is people just don’t care about their data and will consent to almost anything put in front of them so as to continue using the free service, meaning while regulations such as GDPR might sound all warm and fuzzy, in practice they have few privacy-boosting effects.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/facebook-gdpr.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>A <a href="https://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2011/09/14/do-users-change-their-settings/">study</a> by Jared Spool of User Interface Engineering found that less than 5% of users change their settings at all. Indeed, the only thing the average user will have noticed as a result of the GDPR is the return of the annoying pop-up in the form a “we use cookies” consent box. Worse, it has already worked to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-strict-new-privacy-law-is-sending-more-ad-money-to-google-1527759001">further centralise power</a> in the hands of Google and Facebook:</p><blockquote>“GDPR, the European Union’s new privacy law, is drawing advertising money toward Google’s online-ad services and away from competitors that are straining to show they’re complying with the sweeping regulation. <br><br>The reason: the Alphabet Inc. ad giant is gathering individuals’ consent for targeted advertising at far higher rates than many competing online-ad services, early data show. That means the new law, the General Data Protection Regulation, is reinforcing—at least initially—the strength of the biggest online-ad players, led by Google and Facebook Inc.”</blockquote><p>I have no doubt that on some margins, regulating Facebook will help. But given the money and politics involved, designing the perfect regulation is virtually impossible and not without cost. Every piece of additional red tape will not only increase Facebook’s costs, but also the cost of a potential competitor from competing with Facebook as a place for you to share and store your cat photos. It risks turning Facebook into a utility; it will create artificial barriers to entry not just for a Facebook clone, but for some yet to be conceived idea that may fail at the first hurdle given the additional costs of getting started.</p><p>What happens to the small start-up that hopes to one day replace Facebook by competing on a slightly different margin if it needs to raise tens (or hundreds) of thousands of dollars to comply with the new regulations? It could be an end-to-end encrypted social network, where by “friending” someone you essentially exchange a cryptographic key that decrypts particular content. It could be a completely decentralised, federated system. Whatever. Broad-based “social media” regulation will nip such start-ups in the bud before they can ever see the light of day.</p><h3 id="those-pesky-unintended-consequences">Those pesky unintended consequences</h3><p>There’s also a very real risk of rent seeking and regulatory capture. You can bet your bottom dollar that Facebook will throw billions of dollars at “guiding” industry regulation through lobbying, political donations and “industry consultations”. Facebook will be willing to pay the cost of being regulated if it means its competitors, both present and not yet conceived, will have to pay it as well. How is a startup supposed to compete with the <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-combat-pornography-hate-speech-content-reviewers-220403650.html">20,000 security and content reviewers</a> and small army of lawyers already on Facebook’s payroll?</p><p>Just as Uber decimated the taxi industry, unless a future competitor’s product is leaps and bounds above Facebook’s, the heavily regulated legacy provider will linger on. Facebook will divert some of its profits to political campaign contributions and regulatory compliance costs but will become even more entrenched - ‘utilified’ - in the process.</p><p>Regulating Facebook would be a win for Facebook, regulators, politicians, lawyers, accountants, content screeners, the NSA, etc., but would represent a large unseen loss for consumers who will be stuck with Facebook and its data abuse for far longer than they should. Contrary to what the media, politicians and antitrust lawyers claim, there are lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites">alternatives</a> to Facebook, including social media abstinence.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/facebook-people-dont-care.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="people-like-facebook">People like Facebook</h3><p>A study recently found that the average Facebook user would <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101">require more than $1,000</a> to deactivate their account for just a single year. At the end of the day, Facebook has been able to grow not through monopoly status (e.g. as might a water utility) but by giving consumers what they want in a highly competitive market. In this case, that happens to be a free platform to share their lives to the world in exchange for their data, which it sells to advertisers to fund itself.</p><p>The fact that Facebook maintains so many active users in probably the most competitive sector in the world is proof enough that they are happy with the exchange, so for heaven’s sake please don’t regulate it and unintentionally entrench an advertising company as the social media gold standard for years to come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I try not to dabble in day-to-day events, especially when politics are involved. But Australia’s parliament just passed legislation, with the full support of both major parties I might add, that is at best useless and at worst downright dangerous. It’s called the Assistance and Access Bill (AAB), and here’s why it’s so bad.</p><h3 id="it-seeks-to-do-the-impossible">It seeks to do the impossible</h3><p>According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/australia-rushes-its-dangerous-anti-encryption-bill-into-parliament/">TechCrunch</a>:</p><blockquote>The bill, in short, grants Australian police greater powers to issue “technical notices” — a nice way of forcing companies — even websites — operating in Australia to help the government hack, implant malware, undermine encryption or insert backdoors at the behest of the government.</blockquote><p>The problem is that it’s impossible to provide a secure way to allow law enforcement in while simultaneously keeping malicious actors out. If the government goes ahead with mandating backdoors in encrypted software - one of the problems with the AAB is it’s ill-defined, so its reach could be tiny or enormous - it undermines the security of everything from your loyalty cards to your banking details.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/pandoras-iphone-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>While no one can be sure, I suspect the technical difficulties and security risks of mandating backdoors will be a bridge too far for Australia. More likely it’ll go with what I call the “wrench” strategy, whereby it’ll metaphorically beat people/corporates into backdooring specific people, or blocking access to popular encrypted applications entirely.</p><h3 id="the-wrench-strategy">The wrench strategy</h3><p>The people supposedly targeted by the AAB - the “criminals, the terrorists, the paedophiles”, as Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/a-front-door-not-a-back-door-dutton-s-decryption-laws-explained">described them</a>- will be able to circumvent it relatively easily. If you have something to hide, it’s not difficult to independently acquire or develop your own encryption without relying on a third-party. Sharing files could be done with something as simple as an AES-256 encrypted <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> archive. For chats, a relatively <a href="https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/OTR">easy option</a> would be the XMPP protocol with off-the-record (OTR). Email communication could be secured with PGP via <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>.</p><p>Even if it tried, the Australian government wouldn’t be able to compel foreign individuals or companies which derive little (if any) revenue from Australia, have their full source code available online (open source) and are generally privacy advocates, to backdoor their products. No number of local laws will change that fact. I already use several of these services (e.g. Signal, ProtonMail, Standard Notes) and I’m sure plenty of other “innocent” people, concerned about the privacy violations committed by the likes of Facebook, do as well.</p><p>I admit it’s a different story for major corporations. End-to-end encrypted services may refuse to comply with the AAB (although I suspect Facebook will melt faster than a snowball in hell), forcing the government to lean on Apple or Google - through their App/Play Stores - to deny Australian users access based on their geolocation (or inject malware themselves). It wouldn’t be the first government to do so: a messaging app called Telegram was banned in Russia for <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/telegram-forced-to-give-encryption-keys-to-russian-authorities/">refusing to turn over</a> its private keys.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/xkcd-security.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>But if all else fails - as it will for the vast majority of encrypted applications - the government will need to take its wrench to the end points where information is not encrypted (e.g. the user, or his/her device), something <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-04/encryption-whatsapp-signal-messages-explained/10580208">it already had the power to do</a>.</p><h3 id="it-was-rushed">It was rushed</h3><p>Despite having nearly two years to debate and consider numerous issues relating to the AAB, it was rushed into law before Christmas to avoid an “egg on face” political moment. You see, if an attack occurred over the holiday season - regardless of whether the AAB would have done anything to prevent it - the governing Liberal party would be able to call the opposition Labor party “weak on national security”. 2019 is an election year, meaning as usual political incentives triumph over logic, reasoning and the people of Australia.</p><blockquote>The laws of Australia prevail in Australia, I can assure you of that. The laws of mathematics are very commendable but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.</blockquote><p>The above quote is from former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who was defending the AAB way back in the middle of 2017. It was a silly thing to say but it has also been taken out of context by privacy advocates, which did them no favours.</p><p>What Malcolm Turnbull meant was <strong>people </strong>living in Australia have to obey the laws of Australia. The laws of mathematics always apply but if you’re heavily fined or even incarcerated for using them, then there’s a good chance Australians won’t be building or using products based on the laws of mathematics. Not only that, but foreign companies may not want to develop or launch their products in Australia if their and their clients’ data are at risk.</p><p>Now that it’s law, the AAB will have very real, if difficult to calculate, economic and social costs.</p><h3 id="it-leaves-people-exposed">It leaves people exposed</h3><p>The target of the AAB (I think; it’s deliberately opaque) is end-to-end encryption, which works as follows (image courtesy of <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/what-is-end-to-end-encryption/">ProtonMail</a>):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/proton-ete-encryption.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The AAB was designed to circumvent the above without “breaking” encryption, which was its original intent. For example, the government may try to compel providers of encrypted services to inject a second, hidden public key right at the beginning of an encrypted conversation. In the above case, Bob would believe he’s encrypting his message only for Alice, but in reality he’d also be encrypting it for the government as well. It’s a strategy the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/30/gchqs-not-so-smart-idea-to-spy-on-encrypted-messaging-apps-is-branded-absolute-madness/">British have publicly discussed</a>, and the Americans have already tried (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/30/gchqs-not-so-smart-idea-to-spy-on-encrypted-messaging-apps-is-branded-absolute-madness/">ibid</a>).</p><blockquote>In a world of encrypted services, a potential solution could be to go back a few decades. It’s relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call… The service provider usually controls the identity system and so really decides who’s who and which devices are involved - they’re usually involved in introducing the parties to a chat or call. You end up with everything still being end-to-end encrypted, but there’s an extra ‘end’ on this particular communication.</blockquote><p>Businesses operating in Australia will have to comply with requests such as the one above and it <strong>will </strong>have unintended consequences. But practically none of the providers of encrypted communication have servers in Australia, meaning the AAB will be difficult if not <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/australia-anti-encryption-law/">impossible to enforce</a> in the vast majority of cases.</p><blockquote>Fortunately, there is virtually no way to enforce this law outside of Australia because it has no foreign equivalent. ProtonMail, a Swiss company with datacenters only in Switzerland, is not under Australian jurisdiction. Any request for assistance from Australian agencies under the A&amp;A [AAB] law would need to pass the scrutiny of Switzerland’s criminal procedure and data protection laws. Tech companies with a corporate presence in Australia however, are more likely to be impacted.</blockquote><h3 id="my-predictions">My predictions</h3><p>I’m not a betting man but if I were, I think the following outcomes are most likely to occur:</p><ul><li>The Australian technology sector will suffer, but it will be largely unseen. Just the existence of the AAB means clients outside of Australia cannot be sure their data are secure. Australian coders and tech entrepreneurs will increasingly have to move overseas.</li><li>Large foreign companies such as Facebook will fold and give the government secret access to their users’ conversations. Apple will refuse.</li><li>At some point in the future, a request made through the AAB and the subsequent security hole (e.g. poorly implemented malware) will result in the theft of hundreds of thousands of users’ private data.</li><li>Very few criminals, if any, will be apprehended as a direct result of the AAB, nor will any terrorist attacks be thwarted because of it.</li></ul><p>Benjamin Franklin wrote that “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety”. The worst thing about the AAB is there is no demonstrable gain to safety, with Australia’s politicians <a href="https://junkee.com/encryption-bill-labor-vote/185652">almost unanimously</a> trading their constituents’ liberty for a few magic safety beans.</p><p>As a “nothing to hide” passive consumer of encryption, whether through WhatsApp or even TLS (the padlock next to a website’s name), you are the target of the AAB. Not from the Australian government but from criminals or foreign governments that will be able to, at some point in the future, exploit poorly implemented or undermaintained vulnerabilities injected into the numerous applications you use on a daily basis.</p><p>The whole AAB debacle, from inception to implementation, reads like a bad joke. But I suppose it was to be expected from the same politicians under whose watch <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/31/top-secret-australian-government-files-secondhand-shop">hundreds of top secret cabinet documents</a> were found in two locked filing cabinets at a second-hand furniture store.</p><p>What could possibly go wrong?</p><p><em>Note: The festive season draws near and I will be travelling over the next two weekends. I hope to get at least one article out over that period but if not, now you know why.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The internet as we know it today is largely one where most things we encounter are provided for free. You can browse this website for free. When you search for something on Google, it doesn’t charge you. Facebook? Free. But as we economists are fond of saying, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Someone is paying. In terms of this website, I provide the content for free because I enjoy writing about technology and want to share my thoughts on a platform where I have full creative control. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a> bears the cost of hosting this site on the hopes that I’ll upgrade to a paid plan sometime in the future. But that’s not true for Google and Facebook, two very profitable public internet companies that directly charge their users very little.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/google-facebook-net-income.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>I would have added EconByte to the chart but there’s not much point when it would only show as a flat line across the $0 intercept. Also, note that I’m singling out Google and Facebook only because they’re the largest companies with “free” products of which I’m aware. So how do Facebook and Google generate those profits? One word: advertising.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/facebook-revenue-by-segment-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="follow-the-money">Follow the money</h3><p>Google and Facebook charge companies for access to their users. The more people that use their services, the more companies are willing to pay for access to those users. But that model essentially removes prices from one side of the equation, meaning users of the “free” service - unable to weigh up the costs and benefits in dollar terms - have to decide whether or not to consume more through some other means. One way is through simple enjoyment. If Google and Facebook show too many adverts, or adverts that are too intrusive, people will leave the platforms for a competitor. That’s one reason why Google’s adverts are so discreet - if it plastered obnoxious advertising all over its homepage, people - and then advertisers - would quickly abandon it.</p><p>Facebook’s adverts are a bit more intrusive and show up either directly as adverts (e.g. in the right column) or as “sponsored” posts, images and videos. Here’s an example Facebook advert from <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/facebook-ads/">Neil Patel</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/facebook-ad-example-hootsuite.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The sheer number of people who use Google and Facebook mean that they’re generally happy with the trade-off. I’m personally not a fan of the exchange; the price of using Facebook is too high for me and I eschewed the social network several years ago. Admittedly Google can be hard to avoid and I still rely on it for a couple of services, but I haven’t missed Facebook.</p><h3 id="there-are-other-ways">There are other ways</h3><p>I recently started using Brave browser instead of Firefox (I’ll post a referral link at the bottom of this post). It calls itself “a free and open-source web browser developed based on the Chromium web browser and its Blink engine”. It’s a privacy-focused browser which blocks adverts and trackers, but with one big difference: a pay-to-surf business model. Users help to support content creators through microtransactions by either tipping or through the “Brave Rewards” mechanism, whereby you set aside a pool of funds that is distributed every month to websites that grab your attention.</p><p>The whole thing is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, using the “<a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token</a>” or BAT. That means transaction fees are far lower than with traditional banking, allowing microtransactions to actually take place (PayPal and Stripe, for example, charge around 2.9% and 30c per transaction).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/bat-triangle.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>I’m not sure whether it’ll survive in the long run but I think it’s a move in the right direction. Advertising is obnoxious and always involves a breach of trust and privacy to some degree. At least with the Brave browser, you’ll be able to opt-in to advertising and be compensated for the inconvenience.</p><h3 id="amazon-is-on-board">Amazon is on board</h3><p>Well, kind of. Amazon just announced the Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, or QLDB, based on blockchain technology (the “AWS Managed Blockchain”).</p><blockquote>Amazon QLDB is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log ‎owned by a central trusted authority. Amazon QLDB tracks each and every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/amazon-quant-info.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>For crypto enthusiasts such as myself it’s good news: finally one of the big tech companies has entered the blockchain space. I wasn’t sure which of the FAANGS would get there first but was pretty sure it would be Apple or Amazon, given neither of those companies rely on advertising for their revenue. It also makes sense for it to be Amazon over Apple; the company’s most profitable division is AWS (its on-demand cloud computing platform), whereas Apple is still in the device business.</p><p>Amazon’s blockchain implementation looks to be centralised, with the AWS Managed Blockchain run only on Amazon’s servers. Amazon will charge a fee for the service based on usage, a step in the right direction - and the centralised solution is essential for corporates that need to tick all of their regulatory boxes - but it’s certainly nothing revolutionary.</p><h3 id="what-i-want">What I want</h3><p>What I would love to see is more decentralisation with data controlled by individuals, not corporates. Centralised solutions are always going to be more vulnerable to failure (e.g. hacking) than their decentralised equivalents. As I was writing this post, news broke that the Marriott hotel chain <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/marriott-hack-protect-yourself/">had been breached</a>, exposing 500 million customers’ data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, date of birth, gender, trip and reservation information and passport numbers.</p><p>If a more robust, decentralised system had been available for the Marriott to store its data - for example, a distributed blockchain where user data are encrypted with private keys - there would have been nothing to steal in the first place. Hotel guests would verify themselves when booking or checking in using their private key, ideally secured with multi-factor authentication (e.g. a password and physical token such as a YubiKey). No backdoors or master key for hackers to exploit.</p><p>Unfortunately, I think we’re still a while away from that model. The Marriott hack was no doubt a public relations nightmare, but I’d bet that from a purely financial point of view a centralised option would still be preferred. For if it had a fully distributed, decentralised database as described above, it wouldn’t be able to harvest its users’ personal information to sell to a third party or improve its own direct marketing ability. There’s also the fact that privacy and security are less convenient for the average user than more vulnerable, centralised alternatives, meaning some clients might be put off by having to take responsibility for their own data.</p><p>People vote with their feet (or in the internet’s case, their hands) and so the evidence suggests we’re not yet at a point yet where the cost of “free” is greater than the inconvenience of having to pay a few dollars for an alternative. Facebook <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/facebook-hack-data-breach-news-what-to-do">was hacked</a> and has an awful history of abusing its users’ privacy, yet not only do people keep using it but its user base keeps growing. It’s not as if there aren’t alternatives.</p><p>I think whatever model eventually triumphs, it won’t just have to equal the likes of Google and Facebook, but far exceed them. People can be reluctant to pay for something that they currently get for “free”, even if it’s not actually free.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A hallmark of Apple over the past two decades (perhaps longer, my Apple history isn’t the best) has been its “walled garden”; the Apple “ecosystem”, where if you buy one Apple product you’re going to want to buy more because they don’t play well with others. As Steve Jobs used to say, if you had an Apple product, “it just works”. And one reason for that were the limitations that Apple placed on every device in its ecosystem: hardware; software; apps; even the accessories. It all had to be Apple, or it would become a major pain in your backside.</p><p>I’m not sure if Steve Jobs was familiar with the path dependency literature, or whether he was just a smart guy who realised that once consumers had learnt how to use one of his products, if the switching costs were high enough then they would be more likely to just stay with Apple.</p><p>A bit of background for those new to the concept: everyone who has used a computer probably did so with a QWERTY keyboard. Economists used to cite it as a clear example of “market failure”, where producers and consumers were “locked-in” to an inferior standard. A competitor, the Dvorak layout, was technically superior in terms of pure typing speed but people didn’t switch.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/dvorak-layout.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Two economists decided to investigate the phenomena in more detail (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/765077?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis</a>). They concluded that the cost of retraining to get everyone using a Dvorak keyboard was not worth paying - that is, the efficiency gains from switching were not large enough to overcome the costs of switching. Even in a situation where a company has a monopoly as a result of network effects (e.g. everyone I know uses an iPhone, so having an iPhone is more important to me), there’s <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=554686">no coordination failure</a>:</p><blockquote>These monopolies … are efficient outcomes in network industries, where the network effect, or scale economy, is strong. It is not our argument that such monopolies would never arise, but rather that these monopolies would not be locked in. Such industries are serial monopolies; one monopoly after another. … The stakes are always high in such industries. The new entrant seeks not to coexist with the incumbent, but rather to replace it. These high stakes, and the rivalry that they create, is apparently sufficient discipline to hold monopoly prices in check and to keep the rate of innovation very rapid.</blockquote><p>Steve Jobs’ time at Apple was all about lock-in, especially with mobile devices. If you used an Apple device your life would be a lot easier if you also used iTunes, iMessage, iCloud, Apple Mail, Apple Maps, the App Store, not to mention a myriad of Apple-specific accessories. You had to. Apple’s software either didn’t exist outside of the Apple ecosystem, or if it did, didn’t play well with non-Apple hardware. Steve Jobs essentially built digital walls that you would have to climb over to get out, a painstakingly time-consuming process that was often not worth the potential financial savings.</p><p>But as Google’s Android developed into a legitimate competitor to Apple’s iOS operating system and third party hardware manufacturers such as Samsung caught up, that changed.</p><blockquote>Well they blew the horns And the walls came down They’d all been warned And the walls came down They stood there laughing They’re not laughing anymore The walls came down — The Call</blockquote><p>In 2016, faced with declining iPhone unit sales for the first time ever, Apple <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/06/13/apple-is-breaking-down-its-walled-garden-to-keep-selling-iphones/#4c88e24470cc">opened up</a>Apple Maps, Siri and iMessage to third party developers with the idea being that it would boost revenue in its core business, iPhone sales. But it didn’t work as well as hoped, with sales continuing to plateau. So Apple took a different tack: services. To do so, Apple had to dismantle the wall even further by allowing developers even more access to its phones.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/iphone-sales-and-revenue-2018-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>With device sales stagnating, Apple declared services to be the future, as virtually all of its revenue growth was coming from the App Store and licensing agreements (more on that later). And earlier this month, the company - to deflect investor attention from sales of its devices - <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/11/01/apple-will-no-longer-report-iphone-mac-and-ipad-unit-sales">announced</a> that it would no longer report unit sales for three of its most important products, the iPhone, iPad and Mac. Investors weren’t impressed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/apple-no-more-units.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Goldman estimates that Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-09-28/apple-looks-down-on-ads-but-takes-billions-from-google">now generates almost $9 billion</a> from its licensing agreements with Google. Google! A company upon which Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/10749457/Steve-Jobs-planned-Holy-War-with-Google.html">once declared</a> a “holy war”. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/14/google-paying-apple-3-billion-to-remain-default-search--bernstein.html">$3 billion</a> of that is so that Google is set as the default search engine on Apple’s devices. So for all of Apple CEO Tim Cook’s moral posturing about the importance of user privacy and the evil “<a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2018/the-data-industrial-complex">data industrial complex</a>”, his actions reveal that he’s more than happy to trade it for a cheeky billion or three. But that’s a story for another day.</p><p>Essentially, the days of Steve Jobs’ walled garden and his “holy war” against Google are gone. Apple is now dependent on not just removing the wall’s remaining rubble, but paving a path into its ecosystem so that it can continue to grow services revenue. For while it’s all well and good to sell your users’ privacy to Google for a quick buck, Apple’s core business remains just as dependent on iPhone sales as it has been for years; its App Store commissions are directly related to the number of people using Apple devices. All else equal, fewer Apple devices translates into less App Store revenue.</p><p>How Apple plans to move forward from here, I’m not sure. While Google has its entire array of applications on Apple’s App Store, I could only find Apple Music, Beats Pill+ and a “Move to iOS” app on Google Play. Incidentally, Apple Music - for which it charges a recurring $9.99 monthly fee - is one of the company’s fastest-growing services.</p><p>Most of Apple’s software has thrived inside the walled garden. But with the walls coming down, will it be able to compete on a level playing field? Once you take away the iPhone, how does iCloud stack up against Dropbox and Google Drive? Can Apple compete with Microsoft’s Azure or Amazon’s AWS (Amazon’s most <a href="https://econbyte.com/2018/issue-11">profitable division</a>)? I’m not so sure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon recently announced the “winners” of its HQ2 competition, New York City and Northern Virginia (Washington D.C.). I put “winners” in inverted commas as while there are without a doubt winners and losers, it’s not a given that the chosen <strong>city</strong> is actually a winner at all. But look at Seattle, you might say. Amazon itself estimates that between 2010 and 2016, its local spending <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2017/10/17/16488894/amazon-seattle-headquarters-south-lake-union">added $38 billion</a> to the city’s economy, with every dollar invested worth about $1.40.</p><p>Economic multipliers aside, it’s true that Amazon spends a lot of money. It also employs a lot of people. But so do other businesses, even in the technology sector. Facebook and Google have <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/11/08/facebook-and-google-say-they-didnt-get-state-subsidies-why-should-amazon-688859">come out</a> and said they took no state subsidies to develop their respective headquarters. Why is Amazon special?</p><h3 id="home-is-where-the-heart-is-until-it-becomes-too-expensive">Home is where the heart is, until it becomes too expensive</h3><p>Amazon’s home - HQ1 - is in Seattle, where it has a huge presence. It employs over 45,000 people and owns 13.6 million square feet of real estate (nearly 1.3 million square metres), <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/amazon-seattle-office-space-13-point-6-million-square-feet.html">with</a>:</p><blockquote>…the largest footprint by both raw area and percentage of any single company in any single city. Between 2014 and 2017, Amazon went from occupying 9 percent of the city’s prime office space to 19 percent.</blockquote><p>It received no subsidies, tax breaks or special laws <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/04/is-bezos-holding-seattle-hostage-the-cost-of-being-amazons-home">to operate</a>in Seattle. But therein lies the problem: while Facebook and Google may not have lobbied for special treatment, other companies certainly do. Taiwanese technology giant Foxconn, for example, will receive somewhere in the region of $3 billion to locate its new factory in Wisconsin, receiving a “state incentive package” that runs about 12 times higher than the national average. Yes, subsidising big business is so prevalent in the United States that someone <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/15/wisconsin-offered-foxconn-more-than-virginia-new-york-did-amazon/">built a database</a> to track it all.</p><p>By comparison, the cities hosting Amazon’s new headquarters offered up a paltry combined $2.4 billion in subsidies and investments, although that could rise if Amazon receives the federal tax benefit for which it’s currently applying (meant for economically distressed communities known as ‘<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-amazon-the-nfl-and-trump-can-get-rich-off-a-tax-break-thats-supposed-to-help-poor-people-2018-11-15">Opportunity Zones</a>’).</p><p>But why didn’t Amazon just expand in Seattle, a city in which it already has a huge presence? For one, the city has struggled to keep up with Amazon’s rate of growth. Estimates put the number of direct Amazon and spinoff jobs at 100,000 since 2010 and Seattle is now the third-worst city in the United States in terms of “megacommutes”, commutes of more than 90 minutes, having expanded the number of them <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2018/07/20/the-amazon-effect-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html">by 80% in seven years</a>. Housing prices in Seattle have doubled in the last six years. I know from personal experience that accommodation anywhere near central Seattle is both (a) hard to find and (b) ridiculously expensive.</p><p>But Seattle also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/12/seattle-amazon-head-tax-repealed-one-month">tried to tax it</a>:</p><blockquote>A month after Seattle leaders applauded themselves for landing a small blow against big business in the form of an “Amazon tax”, on Tuesday they hurriedly abandoned it to avoid what they called “a prolonged, expensive political fight”.</blockquote><p>Amazon and other large companies based in Seattle eventually defeated the proposal - a $275-per-employee tax for businesses making over $20 million per year - but why risk further expansion in progressive Seattle when other cities will literally throw cash at you? Relocating your corporate brand in exchange for benefits is as American as football!</p><h3 id="amazon-is-not-special">Amazon is not special</h3><p>Big businesses in the United States have long held cities to ransom with the threat to relocate. Perhaps the best, and most visible example of the phenomenon is the NFL (or any other North American sporting league). Take the Los Angeles Chargers, formerly of San Diego, which has <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/san-diego-refuses-billion-dollar-ransom-as-chargers-head-to-la-1.2935038">received its fair share</a> of public support over the years:</p><blockquote>The problem was the Chargers had already cut an ugly deal with the city in the mid-1990s, one that turned scenic Qualcomm Stadium into a concrete urn. It also forced the city to buy any unsold Chargers tickets for 10 years to guarantee sellouts and bypass a foolish league rule that pulled games off television in any markets where a stadium was not fully sold. <br><br>And yet even with that sham, San Diego might have come through had California’s economy not fallen into near-ruin this century… No way was San Diego handing out $1 billion for a stadium that would sit empty for most of the year. Even assuming the special tax – which would have raised the city’s take on hotel bills to 16 per cent – wouldn’t have pulled money that could have gone to schools and roads, the effort to raise the tax would have taken energy away from tending those schools and roads. Giving Spanos $1 billion, regardless of where it came from, would have sent a terrible message.</blockquote><p>San Diego isn’t playing ball? Easy, move to a city that will. Similar moves by NFL team owners over the years have cost local taxpayers in the region of $6.7 billion since 1997, helping to finance 19 new stadiums and 3 major renovation projects (<a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234573/with-6700000000-in-public-money-nfl-stadium-era-closes">more than one a year</a>!).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/sport-teams-moving-small-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p><a href="http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/161900652/la-rams-relocation-major-sports-guide-nfl-mlb">Source</a>.</p><p>Amazon’s ransom seems reasonable by comparison; at least having Amazon in your city may actually produce some net benefits, unlike <a href="https://econjwatch.org/articles/do-economists-reach-a-conclusion-on-subsidies-for-sports-franchises-stadiums-and-mega-events">sporting subsidies</a>:</p><blockquote>…which cannot be justified on the grounds of local economic development, income growth or job creation, those arguments most frequently used by subsidy advocates.</blockquote><p>Remember the multiplier effect I mentioned earlier? Having Amazon open a headquarters in your city may plausibly pull in employment and investment from other parts of the United States, whereas a football team generally substitutes for other local entertainment spending. Its local spending multiplier will therefore be higher, although the opportunity cost of the government subsidies (e.g. potential public projects with higher rates of return) is likely similar for both.</p><h3 id="what-makes-amazon-odd">What makes Amazon odd</h3><p>Amazon is a technology company masquerading as a retailer. Most of its profits are derived from Amazon Web Systems (AWS), its cloud services division. It generates operating margins <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/4/26/17286316/amazon-jeff-bezos-amzn-q1-earnings-revenue-stock-aws-advertising">consistently above 20%</a>and is therefore incredibly profitable, whereas its retail business - at least outside of North America - consistently loses money.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/amazon-profit-by-segment-2017.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>What that means is that the jobs Amazon is promising these new cities are not your run of the mill retail jobs. They’re high paying, with average salaries of $150,000, and are likely to be technology-focused, rather than logistical (Foxconn’s jobs, by comparison, only pay an average of $53,000). Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/amazons-hq2-jobs-2018-1">had a look</a>through Amazon’s Seattle-based occupations and salaries to see what kind of jobs might show up at HQ2. And guess what? They’re almost all technology-related, with titles such as Data engineer; Business intelligence engineer; Research scientist; Software engineer; Software development manager; Technical program manager; and Database administrator.</p><p>With jobs like that, you’re going to want to locate somewhere that already has some form of clustering benefit; setting up in a city that is already ‘techie’ will make it easier to recruit and retain talent. It also helps when your Founder’s house is <a href="https://www.l2inc.com/daily-insights/no-mercy-no-malice/hq2-and-3">only a short drive</a> away.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/bezos-homes-2018.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>If you can tick the above boxes and get some subsidies and tax breaks thrown in to boot, you’d be foolish <strong>not</strong> to set up shop elsewhere.</p><h3 id="the-real-winners-">The real “winners”</h3><p>Amazon. Amazon, Amazon, Amazon. While the whole contest idea may end up costing it a bit in the long-run if it ever sends out another request for favours in the future, the company is the real winner, not the cities. New York and Washington D.C. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/11/13/for-amazon-hq2-location-decision-was-about-talent-talent-talent/">already have</a>the most people employed in computer and mathematical jobs in the United States. So, some of Amazon’s new jobs may come at the expense of smaller businesses that won’t be able to afford the inevitable higher wage demands as demand outstrips supply.</p><p>Amazon now has three headquarters in populous cities with an abundance of skilled workers, places it probably would have wanted to open an office even without subsidies. So not only has it reduced its costs, but by diversifying across the United States it has reduced the risk of another city council attempting an “Amazon tax” in the future.</p><p>Amazon essentially borrowed a play frequently used by NFL teams and executed it beautifully.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Activision Blizzard, the creators of popular gaming franchises such as Diablo, Warcraft, Starcraft and more recently Overwatch, held their annual BlizzCon event last week. For those unfamiliar, it’s essentially a big gathering of gamers that features Q&amp;A panels with developers, announcements of new games (and playable demos), tournaments, and even costume and talent contests.</p><p>But this year’s event didn’t go down well with fans. At all. Instead of announcing a new game, Blizzard decided to use the platform to launch a mobile-only version of Diablo 3, dubbed Diablo Immortal. The team was promptly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50KBNQe5hTM">booed by the crowd</a>, a rarity at these kinds of events.</p><h3 id="then-it-got-worse-">Then it got worse.</h3><p>Every YouTube video Blizzard uploaded to promote Diablo Immortal was instantly pummelled with downvotes, despite Blizzard’s attempts to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/9tz9xu/downvotes_disappearing_on_the_diablo_immortal/">purge negative comments</a>or simply relaunch the videos. A <a href="https://www.change.org/p/supporters-of-the-diablo-franchise-and-the-spirit-of-what-blizzard-used-to-stand-for-cancel-diablo-immortal-6473b96b-9475-464f-abb3-453565848e9a">change.org petition</a>appeared and quickly received over 40,000 signatories wanting to “Make Blizzard Great Again”, presumably by reducing its focus on Diablo Immortal. Activision Blizzard’s share price tanked.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/blizzard-blizzcon-nov-18-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>I’m personally a big fan of the Diablo franchise, having played all three versions (and their expansions). It’s an action role-playing, much like World of Warcraft, except without the “massively” part. It means you can get the full experience without having to sink too much time or money into it. But will I play Diablo Immortal? No. But then again, I don’t play any games on my mobile phone. Most of the Diablo fans at BlizzCon probably feel similarly, hence the negative reaction. But that’s not the only reason the share price fell.</p><h3 id="it-s-not-the-first-time-">It’s not the first time.</h3><p>This isn’t the first BlizzCon failure but it is the worst. Looking at Activision Blizzard’s share price in the two days following the BlizzCon weekend, it has fallen in all of the past 5 years. Indeed, BlizzCon was only really a success in its first three iterations, with investors left either ambivalent or disappointed every year since 2008.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/blizzard-share-price-after-blizzcon-18.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>My takeaway is that in the context of Blizzard’s development cycle, the timing of the Diablo Immortal announcement was poor. The last time it progressed one of its ‘core’ games - that is, released a new story-progressing game within its Diablo, Starcraft and Warcraft universe (excluding expansions) - was Diablo 3 back in 2012. Blizzard should have offered something else at BlizzCon. Investors were disappointed not because of Diablo Immortal, but because Diablo Immortal was practically all there was (the other ‘major’ announcement was a remastering of its popular real-time strategy game, Warcraft 3).</p><p>Diablo Immortal itself won’t perform as poorly in terms of revenue as the hardcore fanbase will have you think. But it should be considered complementary to the ‘core’ line of games, not the sole focus. Thinking that it would go down well at a big gathering of hardcore, PC-gaming fans such as BlizzCon was foolish and naïve.</p><h3 id="blizzcon-is-overhyped">BlizzCon is overhyped</h3><p>There’s also the fact that Blizzard doesn’t really announce major titles at BlizzCon. Starcraft 2 was announced in May 2007, three months prior to BlizzCon. Diablo 3 was announced in June 2008, four months prior to BlizzCon. World of Warcraft was announced in September 2001, before BlizzCon even existed (and expansions aren’t usually announced at BlizzCon, either).</p><p>Essentially, Blizzard announces and releases games when it’s good and ready, not to line up with an arbitrary, pre-determined date in the calendar. That hasn’t stopped the faithful from attending, however, with the event sold out every year (the cheaper live streaming option attracts <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news=286611/blizzcon-2018-early-virtual-ticket-details-community-infographic-vote-on-favorit">over 10 million viewers</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/blizzcon-press-release-18.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>BlizzCon is a cash cow, a festival of sorts for people who prefer video games to, say, doing a lot of drugs and watching a giant wooden man burn. So while the event itself was underwhelming in terms of what was announced, that’s part and parcel at BlizzCon these days. A lacklustre BlizzCon isn’t going to break Blizzard, and Diablo Immortal will likely help the company in the long-run.</p><h3 id="mobile-is-the-future-">Mobile is the future.</h3><p>The mobile gaming industry in 2017 accounted for <a href="http://mediakix.com/2018/03/mobile-gaming-industry-statistics-market-revenue/#gs.TuCTyto">nearly half</a> of all global gaming revenue. <strong>Half!</strong>That’s huge, so it was only a matter of time before Blizzard, a gaming behemoth, decided to throw its hat into the ring. Allen Adham, executive producer and Blizzard co-founder, had the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/5/18064290/blizzard-diablo-immortal-reaction-explainer-blizzcon">following</a> to say about its decision to pursue Diablo Immortal:</p><blockquote>“The way I’ve been kind of looking at the mixed comments is what those folks are really saying is they desperately, passionately want the next big thing. So I actually think that those two items are being conflated … It’s pretty clear to us that there is a huge audience around the world that is gonna love this title. So hopefully we’ll get there.”</blockquote><p>For Blizzard to succeed with Diablo Immortal it will have to avoid harming the Diablo brand and not detract from Blizzard’s other products, and I think it can do both. For one, development of Diablo Immortal has been outsourced to a <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/11/04/diablo-immortal-angry-fans-blizzard/">company in China</a>, leaving the in-house staff to focus on new titles (Diablo 4?). Second, if anything it will bring the Diablo universe to a whole new generation who have probably never used a computer for gaming.</p><p>I personally won’t be playing it, but then I don’t play mobile games at all; I’m not their target demographic. Diablo Immortal is a play for new markets, both millennials who dislike PC gaming as much as I dislike mobile gaming, and China, which is expected to have 768 million <strong>gamers</strong> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/07/niko-partners-china-will-surpass-1-billion-gamers-and-42-billion-in-game-revenue-by-2022/">by 2022</a>.</p><h3 id="the-real-issue-is-fewer-users">The real issue is fewer users</h3><p>As with Facebook and Twitter, investors are obsessed with the real money-maker: active users. Activision Blizzard on Friday reported its third straight quarterly decline in monthly active users (345 million, down from 352 million), sending its share price down 10%, a fall far more severe than last week’s BlizzCon backlash.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/blizzard-active-users-18.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>People are rightly unsure if Blizzard still has its mojo, or if it has fallen out of touch with the gaming community. Is Diablo Immortal the best it can do? Wyatt Cheng, the lead developer on Diablo Immortal, certainly didn’t help matters when he responded to the crowd’s boos by quipping “do you guys not have phones?”. Ouch.</p><p>Activision Blizzard is still an enormous gaming company with valuable intellectual property and a huge, loyal fan base. But unless it announces something other than a World of Warcraft reboot (“<a href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft:_Classic">Classic</a>”), yet another remastering of an old game, and the worst version of Diablo remade for mobile (1 &amp; 2 were better on all fronts outside of the game engine), then even its most loyal fans will slowly abandon ship and its share price will continue to slide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like to keep my eye on happenings that seem out of place, or what we economists call leading indicators. So I watched eagerly when the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) started to report their third-quarter earnings reports.</p><p>A bit of background. Capital expenditure (CAPEX) has exploded in the last few years, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/02/technology-companies-are-driving-a-capital-spending-surge.html">especially in Silicon Valley</a>. The chief culprits are the FAANGs, which around 2015-16 really started to ratchet up their spending.</p><p>The figure below shows the CAPEX of four of the five FAANGs (2018 is my full-year estimate). I excluded Netflix as although its spending trend is similar - up 248% in the last five years - total CAPEX is just 420 million, well below the other four.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/faang-capex-nov-2018-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>While Google is the biggest spender at an estimated $24 billion, the real outlier is Facebook. Its CAPEX has risen from $1.36 billion in 2013 to an estimated $12.54 billion in 2018, for an increase of about 822% in just five years. It now invests almost as much as Apple and about the same as Amazon, even though it’s a “social media company” (it’s not; <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2018/social-media">see my earlier work to find out why</a>).</p><h3 id="misplaced-optimism">Misplaced optimism?</h3><p>Clearly these companies are optimistic about their future growth prospects; Facebook, Amazon and Apple are spending about the same as <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/XOM/financials/cash-flow/quarter">Exxon Mobil</a> - a major oil company - and Google is spending more. They’re also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-tech-firms-are-winning-the-r-d-spending-race-with-china-1540873318">spending big</a> on research and development, with Amazon blowing $22.6 billion in the year ended 30 June, up 40% from a year earlier (Google spent $16.2 billion). But given the seemingly constant stream of privacy violations and intense competition in a constantly evolving sector, is that optimism misplaced?</p><p>Amazon and Apple are your more traditional, consumer-focused companies. Apple makes phones and other gadgets and sells them directly to you. Amazon is effectively a massive retailer, even if its profits are almost entirely derived from its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/26/amazon-profit-second-quarter-2018-advertising-cloud">cloud services</a>. They both need to invest in factories, retail outlets, logistics, and so on.</p><p>But Google and Facebook are <a href="https://econbyte.com/2018/issue-6">advertising companies</a>. They really only need office space for their employees (Google spent $2.4 billion on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/google-bought-manhattans-chelsea-market-building-for-2-4-billion/">piece of commercial real estate</a> in New York), along with data centres and computing equipment to power their services. It’s hard to imagine needing to spend nearly $15 billion when your products are essentially a couple of web and mobile applications.</p><p>When quizzed on that topic <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebooks-expense-growth-to-soar-as-much-as-60-in-2018-1509574741">late last year</a>, Facebook CFO David Wehner cited the following reasons for the CAPEX splurge:</p><ul><li>Sizable security investments in people and technology to strengthen its systems and prevent abuse.</li><li>Investing aggressively in video content to support the Watch Tab.</li><li>Continued investment in long-term initiatives around augmented and virtual reality, AI and connectivity.</li><li>Substantial investments in its infrastructure to support growth and improve its products.</li></ul><p>Mark Zuckerberg noted that the company was planning to have 20,000 people working on safety and security in 2018, up from 10,000 in 2017. But even if you paid them all $100,000 a year, that only accounts for 1 of the additional 6 billion in new CAPEX this year. So the rest must be going into infrastructure for video and connectivity, along with possible future ventures such as virtual reality and AI.</p><h3 id="time-will-tell">Time will tell</h3><p>Only time will tell whether the new ventures will pay off and reward these companies for their investments. I’m sceptical of AI. I think there is little doubt it’ll improve productivity in numerous sectors (e.g. driverless vehicles), but also that firms are spending far too much on anyone or anything that says it’s an AI expert. It has limitations (which I’ll get into in a future note) and so much of it will turn out to be vapourware, with the capital ultimately wasted. I’m also not sold on virtual reality, but I suppose if you’re an advertising company and you don’t at least explore the technology, it could be your death knell.</p><p>But whatever you think of the technologies, it’s a risky strategy to invest so much this late in the business cycle (we’ve now had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_economic_expansions_in_the_United_States">111 months</a> of economic expansion, or nearly 10 years of constant growth). But it’s also hard not to. 2018 is shaping up to be the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=lRiO">best year</a> since the last recession and financial conditions are the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NFCI">easiest they’ve been</a> since the early 1990s. You’d be crazy not to spend.</p><p>Indeed, investors love the FAANGs in part <strong>because </strong>they spend so much; their lofty valuations are driven by future earnings prospects, which are predicated on today’s large investments paying off sometime down the road.</p><p>However as the saying goes, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry and it won’t take much for those valuations to come crashing back down to Earth. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, the fiscal stimulus from Trump’s tax cuts will wear off, and I suspect China is faring worse than many people realise.</p><p>Personally I think you’d be brave to buy the FAANGs this late in the cycle, even if you thought the explosion in CAPEX had been perfectly allocated (note that I’m a relatively risk averse investor).</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I dish out a lot of hate to Facebook and Twitter on these pages. They’re advertising companies that offer users a free social media experience in exchange for all of their (and their friends’) data.</p><p>I feel uncomfortable about the amount of information these organisations are entrusted with, so I personally keep the amount I feed them to a minimum. Where possible, I prefer to maintain control of my own data.</p><p>But for those who cannot do without a social network, there are alternatives. <a href="https://gab.com/">Gab.com</a> (formerly Gab.ai) promises to be different. Gab says it is:</p><blockquote>A social network that champions free speech, individual liberty and the free flow of information online. All are welcome.</blockquote><p>But is that all Gab is; a promise to be different? I decided to have a look at its privacy policy and terms of service to find out how it differs. Here’s what I discovered:</p><h3 id="terms-of-service">Terms of service</h3><ul><li>We will use your User Content to run the App; we won’t take your User Content and sell it to others.</li><li>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion.</li><li>You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of your User Content (such as comments or messages you make) may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on the Services.</li></ul><p>I don’t see anything too scandalous with the above. The only issue I have is that Gab can change its terms whenever it so chooses. That’s standard in these kind of agreements, but what would happen if Gab went bust? Would it be able to change its terms to allow the selling of user content? I suspect the answer is yes. Moving on:</p><h3 id="privacy-policy">Privacy policy</h3><ul><li>We use automated data collection tools to collect certain information. Some third party services providers that we engage may also track and report information about how and when you interact with our App and information about your mobile device (such as device hardware, operating system, and location).</li><li>We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties… Information that we collect from our users, including your email address and, if you opt to add it, a photograph or picture of you (PII), is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</li></ul><p>The above is a bit more concerning. Gab has essentially given itself a ‘get-out’ clause, whereby it’ll be able to distribute user data to the highest bidder in the event of a change of ownership. That day may come sooner than many think: as I’m writing, Gab is still offline following the recent shootings in Pittsburgh.</p><blockquote>“Gab has been no-platformed by essential internet infrastructure providers at every level. We are the most censored, smeared, and no-platformed startup in history, which means we are a threat to the media and to the Silicon Valley Oligarchy. <br><br>As we transition to a new hosting provider Gab will be inaccessible for a period of time. We are working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. Thank you and remember to speak freely.”</blockquote><p>My initial view of Gab when I first signed up last year was that it didn’t offer anything that Facebook and Twitter wouldn’t quickly solve if demanded by enough of its users. It’s essentially the same product - a centralised, trust-based model - with a right-wing hue.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for competition and innovation in the social media sector so it’s great that it exists. It’s just that I have serious doubts as to whether (in its current form) it’ll be able survive, let alone supplant the existing Facebook/Twitter hegemony.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the <a href="https://www.privacyconference2018.org/en/40th-international-conference-data-protection-privacy-commissioners">40th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners</a>, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook stole the headlines when he - without naming names - referred to something he dubbed the “data industrial complex”, where:</p><blockquote>“Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency. Every day, billions of dollars change hands and countless decisions are made on the basis of our likes and dislikes, our friends and families, our relationships and conversations, our wishes and fears, our hopes and dreams. These scraps of data, each one harmless enough on its own, are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold.”</blockquote><p>He has two companies in mind, both of which happen to be competitors of his (one more so than the other). Those two companies are Google and Facebook, which survive by <a href="https://econbyte.com/2018/issue-5">bundling and selling</a> the information that millions of people, knowingly or not, upload to their servers on daily basis.</p><h3 id="this-is-surveillance-">This. Is. Surveillance.</h3><p>The above heading is from Tim Cook’s speech. He’s right, but I think he takes it too far. The only way these companies are able to track you is by using the information <strong>you</strong> give them. Facebook didn’t install a tracking device on your phone; <strong>you</strong> did (e.g. its Messenger app). Google only knows about your interests because <strong>you</strong> plugged them into google.com, or <strong>you</strong> used its mapping service to find a restaurant.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, the practice leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I personally try to avoid the ‘data industrial complex’ companies wherever possible, for example by using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> instead of Google, <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>instead of messenger, and deleting the malware that is Facebook entirely. There are plenty of privacy-focused alternatives out there, it’s just people - demonstrated by their actions - don’t seem to care.</p><p>I should also add that Tim Cook has a clear vested interest here. He may very well be an angel, but Apple doesn’t rely on advertising revenue to survive (although it has pocketed some of Google’s by <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/24/apple_ceo_tim_cook_privacy_data/">selling its users’ data</a>), so if the government regulated that business model away then it would likely benefit Apple. Thus I wasn’t surprised when I heard his proposed solution:</p><blockquote>“We should celebrate the transformative work of the European institutions tasked with the successful implementation of the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation]. We also celebrate the new steps taken, not only here in Europe, but around the world. In Singapore, Japan, Brazil, New Zealand, and many more nations, regulators are asking tough questions and crafting effective reforms. <br><br>It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead. We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States.”</blockquote><p>A federal privacy law might help on some margins, but I’m skeptical as to the ability of politicians to get it right. The winners will almost certainly be the FAANGS (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google), as they will throw an enormous amount of resources at whatever legislation is proposed to protect (and further) their interests. Facebook has literally <a href="https://qz.com/1235120/mark-zuckerberg-says-facebook-should-maybe-be-regulated/">asked</a> to be regulated in the past.</p><p>The losers will be the usual suspects: consumers, who will probably have to deal with yet another annoying “we use cookies” pop-up box on every website they visit; and smaller companies, or competitors that do not even exist today, which will find it too costly to comply with the new rules.</p><p>Will a new law actually protect people’s privacy? Not really. Legislators don’t know enough about it so will rely on industry feedback, which have the effect of watering it down. Terms of service agreements will probably get a bit longer and require a few more clicks. It may also force companies to get creative with how they use your information, but it won’t stop them collecting it.</p><p>The only way to truly protect your data is through encryption, something the Australian government and many others are <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/australias-anti-encryption-law-will-merely-relocate-the-backdoors-expert/">actively working against</a>. Essentially, the very same people Tim Cook wants to draft up legislation to protect your privacy are hard at work <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/07/australia_consi.html">undermining it</a>.</p><p>Go figure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media has copped a bit of flack in recent times. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-to-congress-the-key-moments">dragged before Congress</a> to testify about privacy, data mining, regulations and the whole <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html">Cambridge Analytica controversy</a>. More recently, Facebook revealed that about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-hack-check-if-account-affected/">30 million</a> of its users had their accounts breached via the theft of access tokens (which allow you to stay signed in).</p><p>Twitter has been accused of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/26/what-is-shadow-banning-conservatives-twitter-trump">shadow banning</a>” controversial (mostly right-wing) individuals and groups. If you get shadow banned you stop showing up in searches, user feeds and such. You essentially become a ghost, able to tweet but no one can hear you.</p><p>Google gave up completely and closed its social media platform, Google+. The final nail in the coffin for the ailing network came after discovering it had left <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/google-plus-users-mourn-shutdown.html">private profile data exposed</a>.</p><p>It all begs the question: have we reached peak social media? The <em>New York Times</em>, for the first time that I am aware, published an article helping people disconnect. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/technology/personaltech/how-to-delete-facebook-instagram-account.html">How to Delete Facebook and Instagram From Your Life Forever</a> provides a step-by-step guide for people who want out, from backing up your data to the deletion process itself.</p><p>I purged my Facebook account over 5 years ago. I actually deleted it but apparently “delete” really meant “deactivate”, as everything was still there when I signed in again a few years later. So I went through the process of removing just about everything I had previously uploaded to the network (the process is easier than it sounds with the use of third-party tools). I did the same with Twitter just a few weeks ago.</p><p>Now I don’t for one second believe I’m some kind of thought leader, moving well before the masses with my decision to ditch social media. I just wasn’t getting enough value out of them given how much personal information I had to sacrifice. And the data do indeed show the opposite: more people than ever are using social media.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/facebook-users-oct-18-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/twitter-users-oct-18.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>My decision to abandon Facebook was made around the middle of the first chart, right when growth in the number of users really accelerated. Conversely, I only quit Twitter a few weeks ago, yet its growth plateaued back in 2014! I’m clearly not ahead of the curve.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean I can’t be skeptical about the future of social media <strong>as it currently exists</strong>. Social media is a great way for people to organise events, stay in touch and connect with one another. But I’m not sure how centralised platforms such as Facebook, the business model of which <strong>depends</strong> upon harvesting user data for profit, can survive in the long run.</p><p>Hear me out. Facebook and Twitter are not social media companies; they’re advertising companies. 98 percent of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-revenue/facebook-nears-ad-only-business-model-as-game-revenue-falls-idUSKBN1802U7">Facebook’s revenue</a> and 86 percent of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/120114/how-does-twitter-twtr-make-money.asp">Twitter’s</a> comes from advertising. The two companies provide platforms for their users to network primarily for two reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Direct advertising</strong>. Much like radio and television, Facebook and Twitter display advertising on their platforms. That includes allowing organisations to promote posts/tweets, accounts and even trends. They use algorithms to make sure promoted posts/tweets make it into the right users’ feeds.</li><li><strong>Data mining</strong>. Everything you share on social media, whether public or private, is mined. That includes the people with whom you associate, the events to which you are invited, down to your location and the device you use to access the service. This data is used to improve the effectiveness of direct advertising, but it’s also sold off to third parties.</li></ol><p>The provision of the social network enables the above. As the old saying goes, if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product. Social media companies sell you and any information you choose to provide, knowingly or not.</p><p>To date, people seem happy with this arrangement; the growth of Facebook, Twitter and smaller platforms such as Snapchat are testament to that (Instagram is owned by Facebook). But they all use variants of the same model. As do the likes of Google, which data mines your searches and even your email (do you use Gmail? Or send/receive to people using Gmail? Google’s bots scan it all).</p><p>But I’m not so sure this model is viable in the long term. Do I know what, if anything, will replace it? No. But as more and more information about the nefarious nature of how these companies generate revenue is revealed to the public, there will be pushback. Fewer new users will sign up, existing users will give these companies less face time and rivals - for example, encrypted and/or decentralised alternatives (e.g., <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">diaspora*</a>, <a href="http://friendi.ca/">Friendica</a>, <a href="https://gnu.io/social/try/">GNU social</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> and <a href="https://get.wire.com/">Wire</a>) - will slowly capture the more privacy conscious among us.</p><p>I’ll leave you with the following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/feb/08/business.comment">quote</a>, written about a certain social media company:</p><blockquote>“Well on the way to becoming what economists call a ‘natural monopoly.’ … Users have invested so much social capital in putting up data about themselves it is not worth their changing sites … Its massive user base will help maintain its dominance.”</blockquote><p>That wasn’t written about Facebook or Twitter. It was about MySpace, which has since faded into obscurity. Not because of antitrust regulation but because a new competitor, Facebook, was simply better.</p><p>Does the same fate await today’s social network providers? I’m not sure. What I do know is that we live in an ever-changing world where business models need to constantly adapt just for a firm to <em>maintain</em> its status. Today’s advertising and data mining social media model seems antiquated to me, but I’ve been barking up that tree for years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concept of a 4 day work week has been gaining steam of late. For example, German workers recently <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/07/german-workers-win-right-28-hour-working-week/">won the right</a> to work a 4 day week if they so choose. Anecdotally, I’ve been noticing <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/at-work/will-we-ever-achieve-a-four-day-work-week/news-story/754b1c00e8a19b9f4a27712ee5e3dcc4">articles</a> about it appearing every so often and it’s certainly coming up during conversations with a higher frequency than usual (working “0.8”).</p><p>I’m not going to get into the potential economic and social implications of a shorter work week but I have been wondering why the shift is taking place.</p><p>The obvious reason is that most people prefer leisure to work, but that has always been the case. So something must have changed, with the most obvious candidate being the economic environment: households are faring well, so many people are happy to trade a day of work for an additional day of leisure. The data support that theory, with unemployment in much of the world approaching record-lows (in the United States it just hit its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-unemployment-rate-falls-to-lowest-level-since-1969-1538742766">lowest level since 1969</a>).</p><p>In the midst of a recession, for example, I would expect worker desire for a 4 day work week to be low (conversely, employer demand for a 4 day week would rise). But if the labour market is tight, wages are relatively high and good workers are tough to keep, increased worker demand for a 4 day week makes a lot of sense.</p><p>So I thought as a purely speculative exercise I would check Google’s search trends for two topics, “4 day week” and “unemployment benefits”. Here are the results:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://econbyte.com/content/images/2020/02/google-trends-4-day-week-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Correlation is not causation and I suspect that the 2008 spike was caused by the opposite force to what we are seeing today. That is, employers trying to cut costs without firing workers or reducing wages were instead offering employees a 4 day week.</p><p>So what does the recent spike in searches for a 4 day work week mean, if anything? One possibility is employees, aware that a 4 day week is an option given it was offered to them during the last recession, are using the strong labour market to negotiate for more leisure. Perhaps the extra family time that a 4 day week spurs employee productivity, making it mutually beneficial for the worker and employer. It could be some combination of those two and many other forces.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, the sceptic in me sees the increased demand for a 4 day work week as a “top of the cycle” moment. I hope I’m wrong.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend much of Australia’s Eastern seaboard will switch to daylight savings time (DST). Being in Western Australia where it is not practiced (it was defeated in a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/elections/wa/2009/daylightsaving/">compulsory 2009 referendum</a>), the only annoyance is making sure I’m adding 3 hours instead of the usual 2 to the time difference.</p><p>Nevertheless, I am subjected to the debate whenever I browse my favourite news sites, turn on the TV or listen to the radio. The usual arguments cited are energy conservation, more time outdoors, reduced traffic accidents during rush hour, and even crime prevention. These are understandably hard to quantify, with a quick search revealing a U.S. Department of Transportation (1975, 1% saving) and a separate U.S. Department of Energy study (2008, 0.03%) showing small reductions in energy consumption. However, the findings have been disputed, e.g. Matthew Kotchen and Laura Grant <a href="https://econbyte.com/2018/www.nber.org/papers/w14429">found</a> in 2011 that DST actually increased energy consumption by 1%.</p><p>Then there are the rent seekers who tend to come out of the woodwork whenever policy that might benefit them is proposed, e.g. the golf industry, which has lobbied for DST in the past. In 1986 it estimated DST was worth <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/everyday-innovations/daylight-saving-time4.htm">up to US$400 million</a> annually in extra sales and fees (that’s nearly US$1 billion in <a href="https://www.saving.org/inflation/inflation.php?amount=400&amp;year=1986">today’s dollars</a>).</p><p>In terms of costs, from what I can gather the most quantifiable cost comes from an increase in fatalities, especially on roads, following the switch to/from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945700000320">daylight savings</a>:</p><blockquote>“The sleep deprivation on the Monday following shift to DST in the spring results in a small increase in fatal accidents. The behavioral adaptation anticipating the longer day on Sunday of the shift from DST in the fall leads to an increased number of accidents suggesting an increase in late night (early Sunday morning) driving when traffic related fatalities are high possibly related to alcohol consumption and driving while sleepy.”</blockquote><p>Others <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/daylight-savings-time-bad-health-effects-sleep-2016-3/">have argued</a> that our circadian body clocks never adjust to daylight saving time, causing minor jet lag with all of the associated costs.</p><p>Ultimately, the costs and benefits are relatively small and difficult to quantify. In such a situation I tend to err towards the principle of <em>primum non nocere</em>, or first do no harm, and advise against DST.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my many concerns about Australia’s National Broadband Network (NBN) was the toll it would take on future innovation and competition. A legislated monopoly, entrepreneurs would be forbidden from competing with it, eliminating potential consumer benefits before they can even be discovered. Fortunately for Australians, <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2018/10/has-the-nbn-lost-all-relevance/">I was wrong</a>:</p><blockquote>“Lightening Broadband is connecting homes and businesses using microwave links capable of delivering both 100 Mbps download and upload speeds. That’s better than the comparable NBN Tier 100, which offers 90 Mbps download and 30 Mbps upload speeds.” <br><br>“Another telco start-up, DGtek is offering its customers a full fibre alternative service … [it] uses Gigabit Passive Optical Networks (GPON) and runs it directly into tightly packed homes with the dense population of inner Melbourne. As a sweetener, DGtek offers free internet service to government organisations – such as schools and hospitals – in areas they service.” <br><br>“iiNet in Canberra has launched its Very-high-bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL2) as its own superfast network. According to iiNet, it is made up of fibre and copper and provides a faster connection than ADSL and most NBN plans.”</blockquote><p>Then there’s the competition from an area I did forecast, namely 5G wireless broadband:</p><blockquote>“Optus and Telstra are both launching 5G services in 2019. This represents a quantum leap in wireless technology that could win away millions of current and potential NBN customers.”</blockquote><p>The total accounting cost of the NBN is already over $50 billion. With competition on all fronts preventing it from monopoly pricing, and its mandate of cross-subsidisation (e.g., rural households) driving up costs, that figure will only grow.</p><p>At this stage - nearly 10 years after its inception - there’s an almost certain chance that the taxpayer will see a negative return on its NBN investment.</p><p>As the situation worsens, something will give; that’s just how politics works, and the NBN is a political beast. The easy (and wrong) option would be to regulate or tax the NBN’s competition away. The more difficult (and better) option would be to remove the NBN’s legislated fixed-line monopoly altogether and sell it off, owning the loss and salvaging whatever we can from the carcass.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my blog!</p><p>Some background: I used to run an independent economic research firm, Pixelics, but recently accepted a role at the Department of Treasury in Western Australia. Running both at the same time - and avoiding conflicts - took up too much time, so I decided it was best for all involved to close Pixelics down.</p><p>In its place I created <a href="https://github.com/justinpyvis/econbyte">EconByte</a>, a rebranded revival of my former blog Dismal Musings, itself a domain I previously used for a pump.io node. I plan to write on a wide range of subjects, basically anything that I find interesting to which I can add my two cents.</p><p>For the technically inclined, this website is entirely open source, has no database and is compiled with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a Ruby-based static site generator. It uses a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/dyutibarma/monochrome/">Monochrome</a>, a mobile-first minimalist Jekyll theme.</p><p>Why Jekyll? Having run my former business on <a href="https://craftcms.com/">CraftCMS</a> I really wanted something a bit simpler to update, so of course it had to be a static, database- and bloat-free content management system (looking at you, <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>). That left Jekyll, Hugo and Pelican, with my decision made purely on the fact that Jekyll plays best with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a>, which is where this site is hosted free of charge.</p><p>New posts will appear directly on this website. If you would rather receive updates via email, I have a free newsletter. If you prefer using a reader, there’s also an <a href="https://econbyte.com/atom.xml">Atom</a> feed.</p><p>That’s all for now. Once I’ve ironed out all of the kinks (I’ve never used Jekyll before) I plan to post about once a week.</p>]]></content:encoded>
