<p>Yes, I'm writing about the videoconferencing software Zoom <a href="../zoom-there-goes-your-data/">again</a>. The thing is since I sent last week's issue, even more information has come to light about just how bad Zoom really is. It really, truly is pure malware, yet like its malware cousin Facebook, remains incredibly popular.</p><p>Regulators take note: there are enough people that don't sufficiently care about their data security to make the relatively costless switch to an alternative free videoconferencing provider, meaning they ascribe a value of close to zero on the information they reveal during a video call. People who care about privacy and security will use something else, those that don't will use Zoom. In that environment one-size-fits-all privacy regulation will do nothing but harm those who do not value it.</p><p>But back to Zoom. <a href="../zoom-there-goes-your-data/">Last week</a> I alluded to the fact that Zoom shouldn't be trusted because, from day one, it has prioritised just about everything else above its users' privacy and security. Companies with a culture that treats security as a patchwork whack-a-mole exercise rather than something that needs to be built into the core from the start are just asking for a major security breach.</p><p>Zoom is one of those companies. The list of issues revealed <strong>in the past week</strong> has been nothing short of astronomical for a company that had the gumption to claim on its website that it was "end-to-end encrypted" (it's not), so I'm going to list the articles here and you can read whatever tickles your fancy:</p><ul><li><a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">Zoom Meetings Aren’t End-to-End Encrypted, Despite Misleading Marketing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/aa-intergroup-meetings-zoom-bombing-trolls-alcoholics-anonymous-2020-3">Trolls are breaking into AA meetings held on Zoom video calls and harassing recovering alcoholics</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/zoombombing/">Beware of ‘ZoomBombing’: screensharing filth to video calls</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zoom-lets-attackers-steal-windows-credentials-run-programs-via-unc-links/">Zoom Lets Attackers Steal Windows Credentials, Run Programs via UNC Links</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/zoom-doom/">Ex-NSA hacker drops new zero-day doom for Zoom</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186152/zoom-transparency-report-access-now-advocacy-group">Advocacy group calls for Zoom to release a transparency report</a></li><li><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/war-dialing-tool-exposes-zooms-password-problems/">‘War Dialing’ Tool Exposes Zoom’s Password Problems</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204648/zoom-macos-installer-update-privacy-security-concerns">Zoom quickly fixes ‘malware-like’ macOS installer with new update</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/technology/zoom-linkedin-data.html">A Feature on Zoom Secretly Displayed Data From People’s LinkedIn Profiles</a></li><li><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/">Zoom has “rolled their own” encryption scheme, which has significant weaknesses</a></li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/03/thousands-zoom-video-calls-left-exposed-open-web/">Thousands of Zoom video calls left exposed on open Web</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-31/zoom-sued-for-allegedly-illegally-disclosing-personal-data">Zoom Sued for Allegedly Illegally Disclosing Personal Data</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e95m/zoom-leaking-email-addresses-photos">Zoom is Leaking Peoples' Email Addresses and Photos to Strangers</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing">‘Zoom is malware’: why experts worry about the video conferencing platform</a></li></ul><p>That's a lot discovered in a single week. As I wrote <a href="../zoom-there-goes-your-data/">last week</a>, please don't use Zoom, just about anything is more secure (yes even Facebook). <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi</a> is a good alternative, although if you want something end-to-end encrypted then there's always <a href="https://jami.net/">Jami</a>. For one-on-one calls, look no further than <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>.</p><p>Will Zoom survive beyond COVID-19? Yes. It's easy to use, reliable and convenient, and it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/zoom-calls-routed-china/">apologised</a> for some of the revelations above, for example how it routed calls through China and allowed meetings to get "Zoombombed".</p><p>But Zoom will never monopolise the market as its culture of features first at all cost, including its users' security, will deter a sufficiently large pool of people to prevent it from becoming the top dog - it's not 2004 any more! That's now being reflected in Zoom's share price, which has fallen nearly 20% in the past week although is still around double what it was pre-coronavirus.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../../content/images/2020/04/zoom-YahooFinanceChart.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>As I wrote <a href="../a-lasting-impact-of-the-coronavirus/">a few weeks ago</a>, one of the lasting post-coronavirus impacts is likely to be remote work, with Zoom well placed to capture at least some of that market (Microsoft - which acquired the market leader Skype back in 2011 - really <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition">dropped the ball</a> here). There are enough people that don't care about privacy or security - hello Facebook - for Zoom to still do quite well in the post-coronavirus world. Its next move will be its most important.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.
