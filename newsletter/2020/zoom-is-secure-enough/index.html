<p>Regular readers should be well aware of the privacy and security revelations that plagued videoconferencing platform Zoom last month. It was <a href="../zoom-is-proof-people-dont-care/">a long list</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../../content/images/2020/05/zoom-issues.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>What wasn't clear was whether or not Zoom would be able to recover from the public relations disaster. Throughout its 9-year existence it prioritised features and flexibility at any cost, including its users' privacy and security. As I wrote in <a href="../zoom-is-proof-people-dont-care/">Issue 72</a>,</p><blockquote>...one of the lasting post-coronavirus impacts is likely to be remote work, with Zoom well placed to capture at least some of that market (Microsoft - which acquired the market leader Skype back in 2011 - really dropped the ball here). There are enough people that don't care about privacy or security - hello Facebook - for Zoom to still do quite well in the post-coronavirus world. Its next move will be its most important.</blockquote><p>Well Zoom has now made its next move, and it's a good one in terms of improving security: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/zoom-buys-keybase-in-first-deal-as-part-of-plan-to-fix-security.html">it acquired Keybase</a>, a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging and file-sharing service that, up until I heard the news, I used and encouraged others to use. It is essentially the polar opposite of Zoom, in that the security of its users' data were always put first.</p><p>The acquisition of Keybase will give Zoom 25 top-notch security and cryptography experts that should be able to plug the gaping holes that were revealed last month. It's a sign that Zoom is serious about making its service <em>at least</em> as secure as any of the other mainstream competitors, i.e. secure enough for the vast majority of users.</p><p>Unfortunately, the acquisition likely spells the end for Keybase. There was always an element of trust involved as it never open sourced its server code (probably in the hopes of eventually monetising the service), and joining Zoom has destroyed that trust. While Zoom has now moved up a bracket and I would use it for day-to-day collaboration if an organisation for which I worked was paying (end-to-end encryption will only be available on<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/05/07/zoom-acquires-keybase-and-announces-goal-of-developing-the-most-broadly-used-enterprise-end-to-end-encryption-offering/"> paid accounts</a>), Keybase - given its purpose - will now effectively become vapourware.</p><p>If anyone is looking for Keybase alternatives, your best bet is to use some combination of <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a>/<a href="https://about.riot.im/">Riot.im</a> for chat and any mainstream cloud provider with <a href="https://cryptomator.org">Cryptomator</a><a href="https://meet.jit.si/"><a href="https://jitsi.org/blog/e2ee/">.</a></a> I haven't tried it yet, but <a href="https://keys.pub/">keys.pub</a> looks promising as a signing and validation service.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

But what does it do with the data it collects? Uses it to train algorithms to better censor its own citizens:</p><blockquote>Everyone knows that Chinese chat apps do blocking, and sometimes monitoring. But the discovery that the rest of the world is being surveilled in order to train and refine censorship in China shows just how far private companies go to comply with Beijing's self-censorship demands.</blockquote><p>It makes sense.

Apple, Google, Microsoft and Tesla Inc. are among the companies that have placed orders with Loftwall in the last 18 months, Holmes said.</blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-06/tech-offices-will-never-be-the-same-after-coronavirus">The Silicon Valley Workplace Will Never Be the Same</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/health/coronavirus-office-makeover.html">The Pandemic May Mean the End of the Open-Floor Office</a></li></ul>
