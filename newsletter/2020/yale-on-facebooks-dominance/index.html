  <h1 style="margin: 0">Yale on Facebook&#x27;s dominance</h1>
<p style="color:#888888;font-size:0.8em">Delivered on 29 June 2020 by Justin Pyvis. About a 4 min read.</p>


<p>Imagine a dominant company with 75% market share that it achieved only by "misleading consumers and buying up rivals". Then, because of "network effects", it has become nearly impossible for any other company to overcome its lead. It "can collect monopoly rents, manage the flow of information to most of the nation, and engage in virtually unlimited surveillance into the foreseeable future".</p><p>That company is of course Facebook, as analysed by <a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/facebook-s-dominance-is-built-on-anti-competitive-behavior">Yale's Theodore Nierenberg Professor of Economics Fiona Morton</a>. If you were to take her analysis at its face value then the only logical conclusion - which Morton and her co-author David Dinielli also arrived at - would be some form of antitrust, "reversing past acquisitions and imposing a requirement that Facebook work in concert with other social networks".</p><p>The only problem is that the analysis is deeply, fundamentally flawed, and you don't need a <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/Roadmap%20for%20an%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Facebook.pdf">36-page paper</a> to realise how wrong it is.</p><p>First, Facebook doesn't collect <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1057%2F978-1-349-94848-2_430-1">monopoly rents</a> ("earned by firms that are able to restrict supply and/or increase prices without fear of attracting competitors"). Facebook provides its consumer service for free but has <em>lowered prices</em> and <em>improved quality</em> for people who want to advertise. It also faces <em>intense competition</em> not just from other social networks but from Google, television, newspapers, radio, blogs, billboards... essentially any platform that shows advertisements.</p><p>Second, consumers aren't harmed. Consumers have never had more news and media choices than they do today. <strong>Facebook doesn’t have a monopoly on people's attention.</strong> It may be good - very good - at capturing people's attention, but that's not the same thing as a monopoly. It has fiercely competed against other companies and simply done a better job to date.</p><p>Third and finally, the authors wish to impose "a requirement that Facebook work in concert with other social networks". But doing so would effectively set a standard to which <em>all</em> social networks - both present and potential - would have to conform. Such regulations would disproportionately benefit incumbents like Facebook, which can:</p><ol><li>more easily afford the compliance costs; and </li><li>already exist, so will fit whatever 'social network' compatibility definitions are established.</li></ol><p>Some future competitor may not be able to "work in concert" with Facebook because it's built entirely differently, with the regulations stifling its early development (perhaps even sufficiently long to allow Facebook to acquire it!).</p><p>The only part of the Yale paper that I agree with is that "network effects" make it more difficult to leave Facebook. Switching costs are real, but they're not infinite. If a better rat trap comes along you can be sure people will switch to it, just as they switched from MySpace to Facebook.</p><p>You can dislike Facebook (I certainly do). But antitrust is not the answer and if anything would likely work to cement whatever limited market power Facebook has.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.
