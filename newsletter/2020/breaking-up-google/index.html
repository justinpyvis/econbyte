<p>Apparently there's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/states-lean-toward-pushing-to-break-up-googles-ad-tech-business.html">a push</a> within the ranks of US Attorneys General to break up Google, specifically its advertising business:</p><blockquote>Fifty attorneys general have been probing Google’s business practices for months, alongside a similar probe being led by the U.S. Department of Justice. Both the states and the DOJ are looking to file a suit against the internet giant as soon as within the next few months, the people told CNBC. <br><br>The states and the Justice Department have not yet officially decided whether to combine their expected suits, the people said, though they have been collaborating closely. Both have been investigating Google’s search, ad technology and android business. <br><br>The attorneys general investigating Google, which is owned by Alphabet, haven’t yet definitively ruled out pushing for alternatives for its ad technology business, like imposing restrictions on how it runs its business, one of the sources said. A suit may also include a push for both that option and breaking up the ad tech business.</blockquote><p>Let me be perfectly clear: if this goes ahead, it would almost certainly be bad for consumers. Google might dominate digital advertising <em>right now</em>, but that doesn't mean there's a monopoly or antitrust issue. The market is highly contestable and Google dominates the space only because it's better than the alternatives. That's bad for Google's competitors, whether it's in advertising, search or mobile, precisely because it's good for consumers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../../content/images/2020/06/temporary-monopolies.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1105826226080497665">Source</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a reason why most of the big, successful tech companies come out of the United States and not Europe. Breaking up Google would set a dangerous, European-style precedent that would handicap a sector of the US economy that has been responsible for enormous growth and innovation.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of this week's issue.

And it hesitated in absorbing the lessons of other countries, including the perils of silent carriers spreading the infection. <br><br>…the C.D.C. is risk-averse, perfectionist and ill suited to improvising in a quickly evolving crisis — particularly one that shuts down the country and paralyzes the economy. <br><br>Some staff members were mortified when a Seattle teenager managed to compile coronavirus data faster than the agency itself, creating a website that attracted millions of daily visitors. “If a high schooler can do it, someone at C.D.C. should be able to do it,” said one longtime employee.</blockquote><p>The failure appears to be a long running incentive / bureaucratic governance problem, rather than a funding issue (it has 11,000 staff and real funding has increased over time).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/cdc-coronavirus.html">The C.D.C.
