<p>Virus tracking apps are all the rage. Or at least they were, until global governments almost unilaterally messed up the delivery. It turns out they are - almost without exception - awful in terms of data privacy and security. Unfortunately that means they won't work, because a 'critical mass' of people will avoid installing them. Here's the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/virus-tracing-apps-privacy.html">New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote>In fact, “the vast majority” of virus-tracing apps used by governments lack adequate security and “are easy for hackers” to attack, according to a recent software analysis by Guardsquare, a mobile app security company. <br><br>“It’s a cautionary tale for governments aggregating such an enormous amount of data,” said Claudio Guarnieri, the head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab, who identified the problems with the Qatari app.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../../content/images/2020/07/tracing-apps-privacy.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="600" height="524" srcset="../../../content/images/2020/07/tracing-apps-privacy.png 600w"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.guardsquare.com/en/blog/report-proliferation-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-exposes-significant-security-risks">Guardsquare</a></figcaption></figure><p>People will tolerate their data being siphoned off provided they're adequately compensated (e.g. a good search engine, email service, or social network). For many, government contact tracing apps fail that trade-off, which is why it's so important to use the right framework from the start (hint: decentralised, open sourced).</p><p>Have a great week. Cheers,</p><p>— Justin</p><h2 id="other-bits-of-interest">Other bits of interest</h2><h3 id="australia-s-covidsafe-app-is-one-big-fail">Australia's COVIDSafe app is one big fail</h3><ul><li>It has no active user data "due to privacy provisions".</li><li>It is still "plagued with technical bugs… mostly related to the app's struggles when getting iOS and Android devices to ‘talk’ to each other with Bluetooth".</li><li>It does not notify users if they've been in contact with someone infectious, rather "they'll be notified but it will be by a manual tracer".</li></ul><p>This statement by Minister Stuart Rober's office about why the government won't consider the Apple and Google framework was disturbing because it's a lie:</p><blockquote>Public health officials won’t have access to [contact tracing] information, which will reside with Google and Apple.</blockquote><p>The data will reside on people's phones, not with Google and Apple. Public health officials will still receive data but only at the users' discretion.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/07/victoria-covidsafe-figures/">Victoria Won’t Release COVIDSafe Access Figures</a></li><li><a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/melbourne-man-claims-covidsafe-tracking-app-failed-to-notify-him-about-close-contact-with-positive-case/news-story/9b3b13bf1a9a284fc765c724c3885c9d">Melbourne man claims COVIDSafe tracking app failed to notify him about close contact with positive case</a></li></ul><h3 id="covid-19-spreads-very-very-easily">COVID-19 spreads very, very easily</h3><p>Yikes. According to a new paper published in The Lancet, following a mass testing campaign in Belgium's long-term care facilities, 74.8% of those who reported a positive COVID-19 test were either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, with the authors concluding:</p><blockquote>Similar viral loads have been reported between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, making the transmission and spread of the virus possible for both groups.</blockquote><p>If true, it certainly goes some way to explaining how this coronavirus spreads so easily.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30560-0/fulltext">Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Belgian long-term care facilities</a></li></ul><h3 id="softbank-was-an-investor-in-wirecard">SoftBank was an investor in Wirecard</h3><p>Of course SoftBank jumped in right before the crash:</p><blockquote>Wirecard said last year that the Rajah &amp; Tann investigation found no conclusive proof of fraud or corruption. The company never released the full version of the final report. The company characterized the investigation as independent. <br><br>The Financial Times first reported the whistleblower’s claims in early 2019, causing the company’s share price to fall sharply. A few months later, a $1 billion investment arranged by executives of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. gave the company a boost. That October, Financial Times articles questioned Wirecard’s relationships with third-party partners.</blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wirecard-bankruptcy-scandal-missing-$2billion-11593703379">How Wirecard Went From Tech Star to Bankrupt</a></li></ul><h3 id="there-are-no-good-answers">There are no good answers</h3><p>Activity everywhere slowed significantly prior to government-mandated restrictions. People don’t want to catch and spread the virus.</p><p>Successfully controlling the virus means life can return to something resembling normal relatively quickly, albeit at a greater short-term cost.</p><p>Doing little and 'living with' the virus means people will remain cautious and economic activity will be subdued until an effective treatment/vaccine is developed (e.g. Sweden).</p><p>Attempting to do something but failing leaves you with the worst of both worlds.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/business/sweden-economy-coronavirus.html">Sweden Has Become the World’s Cautionary Tale</a></li></ul>
