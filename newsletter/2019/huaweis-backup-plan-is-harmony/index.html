<p style="color:#888888;font-size:0.8em">Delivered on 13 August 2019 by Justin Pyvis. About a 4 min read.</p>


<p>Huawei has a plan and it's... Harmony, with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/09/huawei-harmony-os-hongmeng-android/">capital H</a>:</p><blockquote><em>"Huawei's long-rumored Android alternative, Hongmeng, is finally official. At today's Huawei Developer Conference, the company's Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu surprised the audience by unveiling "HarmonyOS," which he says is faster and safer than Android. Yu says that when Huawei can no longer access Google's Android ecosystem, the company can deploy HarmonyOS "at any time." Until then, Huawei will continue to support Android.</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><em>Yu's presentation was rather technical but in a nutshell, HarmonyOS is positioned as a future-proof, "microkernel-based, distributed OS for all scenarios." The platform is open source, and it's actually more of a competitor to Google's upcoming Fuchsia, given that both are microkernel-based and can be used on multiple types of devices at once. In his on-stage presentation he said that Android isn't as efficient due to its redundant codes, outdated scheduling mechanism and general fragmentation issues. Shots fired."</em></blockquote><p>The United States has it out for Huawei (see the <strong>The bits</strong> below) so this move was inevitable, as what good is a smartphone without a modern operating system? Huawei had to do something and while option A is no doubt to continue using its own launcher on Google's Android, it really, really needed a backup plan.</p><p>What surprised me was not the announcement of HarmonyOS, essentially a not-so-subtle re-branding of "Hongmeng", Huawei's long-rumoured operating system, but that is has been in the works since 2017. As Yu alluded to, "Hongmeng" was likely an operating system designed solely for the internet of things (e.g. speakers, vehicles, watches, fridges), not smartphones. The trade war probably forced Huawei into making it smartphone compatible far sooner than it had intended (if it had ever intended to make the pivot), so that if/when the United States forbids Google from trading with Huawei, it has something it can use on its phones. Huawei is, after all, a hardware company (at least for now).</p><p>My thoughts are that in the short term, HarmonyOS is a negative for Huawei: it's an investment it otherwise wouldn't have made given the choice, which is a decent test of whether a company believes an investment is beneficial or not. But it's definitely a positive for consumers. Why? Huawei's move into the mobile operating system space creates some much-needed competition to the duopoly that is iOS/Android. Better still Huawei is going to make it open source, so even if it fails the scraps can be used in other projects.</p><p>In the longer term, HarmonyOS may even work out for Huawei, provided it isn't completely awful. The mobile operating space is not an easy nut to crack, as Samsung found out with its failed attempt at a mobile operating system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen">Tizen</a>, as did Microsoft with its Windows Phone.</p><h3 id="it-s-good-to-have-a-backup-plan">It's good to have a backup plan</h3><p>Huawei cannot get HarmonyOS out the door soon enough if the "progress" in China's dispute with the United States is anything to go by. First step, a smart TV, which as noted above was probably the original plan anyway. The big test will come when it has to roll it out to mobile phones.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/09/trump-says-us-is-not-going-to-do-business-with-huawei-not-ready-to-make-a-trade-deal-with-china.html">Trump says US government won’t do business with Huawei, not ready to make a trade deal</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-08/u-s-holds-off-on-huawei-licenses-as-china-halts-crop-buying">U.S. Holds Off on Huawei Licenses as China Halts Crop-Buying</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-vision-tv-huawei-harmony-os/">Honor Vision smart TV is the first device with Huawei’s Harmony OS</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-china-analysis/promotions-and-patriotism-battle-mode-huawei-sees-china-smartphone-sales-surge-idUSKCN1UV0VO">Promotions and patriotism: 'Battle Mode' Huawei sees China smartphone sales surge</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="at-what-point-does-profit-become-important">At what point does profit become important?</h3><p>Note to Silicon Valley: a billion-dollar valuation might buy you time but it doesn't guarantee your survival.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/netflix-at-a-crossroads-hollywoods-dominant-disrupter-adjusts-growing-pains-1229618">Netflix Under Pressure: Can a Hollywood Disruptor Avoid Getting Disrupted?</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-lobbying-machine-inside-effort-sway-policy-worldwide-1229622">The Netflix Lobbying Machine: Inside the Effort to Sway Policy Worldwide</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/technology/uber-earnings.html">Uber Posts $5.2 Billion Loss and Slowest Ever Growth Rate</a> »</li><li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/uber-freezes-engineering-hires-amid-mounting-losses/">Uber, losing billions, freezes engineering hires</a> »</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-07/alphabet-s-deepmind-takes-on-billion-dollar-debt-as-loss-spirals">Alphabet’s DeepMind Takes on Billion-Dollar Debt</a> »</li></ul><h3 id="a-good-use-case-for-machine-learning">A good use-case for machine learning</h3><p>Regulations, once passed, are static.
