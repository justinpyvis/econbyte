<p>What a week for Elon Musk, and not in a good way. If you need a refresher:</p><ul><li>After markets closed on Friday, Tesla announced the departure of four board members once their current terms expire.</li><li>On Monday last week, a parked Tesla Model S randomly <a href="https://qz.com/1601177/a-video-showed-a-parked-tesla-model-s-exploding-in-shanghai/">exploded</a> in a Shanghai garage (and it was captured by CCTV).</li><li>Two days prior to Tesla's mid-week first quarter earnings release Musk promised self-driving by the end of this year. But given that we hear that promise every year - Musk first made the claim back in 2015 - he upped the ante, saying Tesla would have one million <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-selfdriving/tesla-says-robotaxis-coming-next-year-touts-self-driving-microchip-idUSKCN1RY1C9">self-driving robo-taxis</a> on the road in 2020.</li><li>The first quarter earnings report was unveiled and wow was it bad, showing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/tesla-reports-702-million-loss-in-first-quarter/">loss of $702 million</a>, or $4.10 a share.</li><li>During the earnings call Musk was asked if Tesla planned to get into the insurance business, to which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/elon-musk-tesla-will-launch-an-insurance-product-in-about-a-month.html">he responded</a>"...yes we are creating a Tesla insurance product and we hope to launch that in about a month. It will be much more compelling than anything else out there". A bold claim given how poorly Musk's promises have panned out in the past!</li><li>Tesla's share price closed at $US235.14 on Friday, its lowest since January 2017.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../../content/images/2020/02/tesla-share-price-april2019.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Let's be honest, we're not going to see a million Tesla robo-taxis on the road by 2020; it's another Musk pipe dream on which he has applied an absurdly short, unrealistic time frame.</p><p>Really the only interesting announcement was the Tesla insurance product, and it wasn't even an announcement but an on-the-fly comment during the investor call. Does Musk actually have an insurance company in the works, or did he just think it was a good idea? The guy has a reputation for shooting from the hip, but insurance does actually make sense: Tesla already spies <a href="https://www.axios.com/what-tesla-knows-about-you-1f21d287-a204-4a6e-8b4a-0786b0afac45.html">on all of its drivers</a>so Musk's statement that people wouldn't be allowed "to drive the car in a crazy way" if they want to keep premiums down claim should actually be relatively easy to enforce.</p><p>It's also a means for Tesla to do one of two things: crack the cash flow market that the likes of Apple have recently pivoted into (monthly subscriptions for everything); and/or bundle the insurance into the sale price as a bit of a loss leader, which is similar to how traditional car dealers bundle free annual services into their vehicle sales.</p><p>The latter is the most intriguing, as it's a point of difference for Tesla which is finally starting to face some healthy competition in the pure electric vehicle sector. That competition is coming at the same time as governments around the world are finally winding down their extremely generous electric vehicle subsidies, which have been Tesla's <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/tesla-s-main-product-isn-t-cars-it-s-subsidies-14769263">bread and butter</a> for some time.</p><p>But will insurance be enough to save a company that haemorrhages <a href="https://qz.com/1604080/tesla-is-losing-money-at-a-frightening-pace/">nearly a million dollars a day</a>? I'm not so sure and I'm clearly not alone, hence the Tesla share price free-fall.</p><h3 id="only-you-not-europe-can-protect-your-privacy">Only you, not Europe, can protect your privacy</h3><p>The fabled General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is enforced in the country in which tech firms have their "data controller".

Take whatever he says with a very healthy pinch of salt.</p>
