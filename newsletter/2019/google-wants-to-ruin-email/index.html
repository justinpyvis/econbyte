<p>Who doesn't love email? Likely a lot of you, but probably because of what you receive through it (or how you manage your inbox) rather than the protocol itself. Email - or rather, the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) - is good at what it does. It lets anyone, anywhere, to send and receive messages regardless of what device or email application they happen to use. In that sense email is federated, distributed and decentralised in that it allows multiple small networks to talk to one another without giving up control.<br></p><p>Google is responsible for a large portion of email traffic through its aptly-named email service, Gmail. It has more than a billion users and as this graphic from <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17570/most-popular-email-clients/">Statista</a> indicates, is neck and neck with Apple's default mail application in terms of usage:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../../content/images/2020/02/email-client-popularity-april-2019-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>But Google wants to capture more than mere market share; it wants to combine static with dynamic. Essentially, the "do no evil" company wants to take SMTP and modernise it using its own protocol, Accelerated Mobile Pages (<a href="https://amp.dev/">AMP</a>), which essentially allows applications/websites to run inside emails. If you use Gmail, you're <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail/">already</a> using AMP.</p><p>The big question is: why? Email is mature, simple and <em>it just works</em>. If you wanted something more than a reliable, static email message to solve your organisation's communication needs, then use something like Slack (although you <a href="https://finelybalanced.com/newsletter/2019/slacking-off">shouldn't</a>).</p><p>The answer is that it makes sense for Google. Its chat/email-alternative, "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-hangouts-g-suite-shutdown-october/">Hangouts</a>", officially failed earlier this year. So it wants to further monetise email, a medium where it already has more than a quarter of the world's users. It has struggled on that front so far because given the federated, decentralised and distributed nature of email, it can only monetise it by using the data it collects from Gmail users (plus their correspondents) and through adverts shown in desktop users' inboxes. But it can't do anything with the email itself.</p><p>That's where AMP shakes things up. With AMP, Google can do oh so much more with a boring email. By turning email into an "interactive, dynamic" medium, it can run advertising anywhere it wants, auto-play videos, and track every single way you interact with any part of the email, all directly from your and your correspondents' inbox (and via any other service foolish enough to sign up to AMP). It's even able to display dynamic website content, after it strips it of competitors' branding, trackers and advertising, of course.</p><p>Just like that, Google controls even more of what we can see and do on the internet. First it <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/e2email-research-project-has-left-nest_24.html">killed off</a> its end-to-end encryption project which would have done the opposite of AMP, i.e. help make email private and secure, and now it wants to ruin email altogether.</p><p>But you don't have to be a pawn in Google's latest evil scheme. I ditched Gmail several years ago and more people should do the same (see my recommendations below). An internet where everything is filtered through Google is one in which I do not want to take part, and you shouldn't either.</p><h3 id="some-alternatives-to-gmail">Some alternatives to Gmail</h3><p>It would be lazy of me not to suggest a few alternatives to Gmail given that I just sledged it above. Any of the mainstream providers - Microsoft's Office 365, Apple Mail - are better than Gmail, but only slightly. If you want one that actually respects your data, consider the below list.</p><p>Note that not all have free options but if you don't want to be the product you should really pay for it, and the best time to do that is on Black Friday or Christmas, which is when most will run their annual promotions. Tip: use your own domain name so that you can move providers when/if required.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://mailbox.org/en/">Mailbox</a> - Native encryption, German provider »</li><li><a href="https://mailfence.com/">Mailfence</a> - Native encryption, Belgium provider »</li><li><a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> - Android/iPhone app, native encryption, Swiss provider »</li><li><a href="https://runbox.com/">Runbox</a> - Norwegian provider »</li><li><a href="https://www.startmail.com/en/">Startmail</a> - Native encryption, Dutch provider »</li><li><a href="https://tutanota.com/">Tutanota</a> - Android/iPhone app, native encryption, German provider »</li></ul><h3 id="what-do-artificial-intelligence-and-the-mississippi-company-have-in-common">What do artificial intelligence and the Mississippi Company have in common</h3><p>They all have/had legitimate promise and real world application but were over-hyped to the point that their downfall was inevitable.
