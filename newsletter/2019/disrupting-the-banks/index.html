<p>I trust everyone had a relaxing Easter long weekend. This week's issue will be shorter than usual as I just want to briefly touch on a subject of immense frustration but more importantly, opportunity: banking.</p><p>If there's any industry that's ripe for disruption it must be the financial sector. Heavily regulated and dominated by a handful of large, often very old corporations, it can be an absolute chore to perform basic tasks that <em>should</em> be easy, such as transferring money. It's a sector seemingly littered with inefficiencies and annoyances at just about every turn, yet it continues to grow in terms of its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP, see the <strong>Image of the Week</strong> at the bottom of this issue).</p><p>I was hopeful that Apple's much-hyped credit card would break out of that mould but it took the easy way out, partnering with a bank to create yet another run-of-the-mill credit card. Then there was last week's announcement that T-Mobile, an internet telecom in the US, would be releasing "T-Mobile Money", a no-fee transaction account that represents <a href="https://gizmodo.com/t-mobiles-next-big-move-is-a-checking-account-1834124070">slightly better value</a>than existing offerings for those will low balances (a 4% interest rate on the first $3,000, with 1% on anything above that). But it's still just same old, same old.</p><p>The financial sector won't be disrupted by tech companies that think they can beat the banks at their own game by producing an expensive card (Apple) or a fancy mobile app (T-Mobile). To truly shake the incumbents will require technology that can get past the requisite utilification of every player in the sector: a way to verify and guarantee transactions without the need for large, centralised systems of trust (banks) and the regulation that - by design - oppresses innovation.</p><p>We may not have invented that technology (yet). But it's looking increasingly likely that we have at least ventured down the right path, and that path is blockchain. The speculative fervor that surrounded everything crypto has passed and as <em>Issue 18/2019</em>pointed out, the wheat is finally being separated from the chaff. Simply existing in the blockchain space is no longer enough; only the best products - in terms of how well they can compete with existing industries (think Uber and taxis) - will grow in terms of market share and potentially, one day, market dominance.</p><p>I'm hopeful that at least one of those products will flip the banking industry upside down, eroding the rents they currently enjoy similarly to how Uber decimated the taxi cartel. The consumer surplus in doing so would be enormous.</p><h3 id="artificial-intelligence-is-great-aside-from-the-name">Artificial intelligence is great, aside from the name</h3><p>As with any emerging field, there will be winners and losers.
